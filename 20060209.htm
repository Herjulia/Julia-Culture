<p><font face="Lucida Sans">1)&nbsp; Warding the space:</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">I perform the hammer sign and call on Asa Thor to provide spiritual 
protection during this rite.&nbsp; I also call on Peacock for His protection.* 
In the air, I trace the following runes:&nbsp; Tiwaz 
to the north; Othalaz to the west; Ansuz to the south; and Kenaz to the east.&nbsp; 
I start a small fire, sprinkled with sage and rosemary.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Lucida Sans">At times, I was helped by you and your saints.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Lucida Sans">At times, my relatives, Grandpa Stahl, Aunt Helen, and Sr. Christopher, 
    were examples to me of kindness, gentleness, intelligence, and every thing 
    wise, high-minded that your followers <i>might</i> be.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Lucida Sans">I am grateful for what you have done in guiding me on this Earth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Lucida Sans">&quot;Shepherd, I follow you no longer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Lucida Sans">Let the Fire of your Spirit return to you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">&quot;I call upon my ancestors as witnesses:</font></p>

I received and email response to my ritual.&nbsp; I am including it, with my 
response:</p>


<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/poetic/poehorsd.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p><i>Hi Tom,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</i></p>
<div>
    <i><span class="gmail_quote">On 2/20/06, ***&nbsp; wrote:</span></i><blockquote 
    class="gmail_quote" 
    style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
        <p><i>I came across your postings in Beliefnet's Asatru<br>
        forums and read the account of your &quot;de-conversion&quot;<br>
        from Christianity.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <div>
        <i><br>
        You have me in the position of knowing even less about you than the 
        little bit you know of me.&nbsp; The challenge here will be to properly 
        interpret the spirit of what you are writing, and getting around my own 
        filters. <br>
        <br>
        If you want a more compelete context in which these events occurred, I 
        will suggest two threads from Bnet:&nbsp; On the Shamanism board, one started 
        under my user name, youthful_spirit, called &quot;Blending Christianity and 
        Shamanism&quot;.&nbsp; I bumped it for you.&nbsp; The other is currently going on on 
        the Asatru Board, called &quot;The Existence of Other Gods&quot;. <br>
&nbsp;</i></div>
    <blockquote class="gmail_quote" 
    style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
        <p><i>I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.<br>
        Most of the Pagan exChristians I know changed <br>
        directions simply by embracing their present worldview<br>
        and leaving the past behind.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <div>
        <i><br>
        Okay, so again, I don't know you.&nbsp; This sounds like you're saying that, 
        since you haven't seen this before, since most Pagans you know didn't 
        feel the need to do this, there is somehow something amiss with me 
        choosing to handle it this way. <br>
        <br>
        I kinda don't follow what other people do when I choose my spiritual 
        activities.&nbsp; I work out, with my guides and&nbsp; intuition, what it will 
        take to make me whole or enriched.<br>
&nbsp;</i></div>
    <blockquote class="gmail_quote" 
    style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
        <p><i>The one concern I have is that the drama of your<br>
        turning away — does it mean this old path still has<br>
        some hold over you? Do you think there is a<br>
        possibility you will have to deal with it again?</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <div>
        <i><br>
        Drama has, to me, quite a useful and healthy function.&nbsp; Most ritual 
        employs drama, literature, art, rolled into a package meaningful to 
        those enjoying it.&nbsp; For me, it speaks to myself on many layers of my 
        psyche, making it essential to deep experience, and deep healing.&nbsp; So I 
        don't understand why you find it of concern.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        In addition, I think you seem to have missed the exact point of why I 
        did this for myself.&nbsp; It is precisely because I have been unsuccessful 
        in freeing myself from it's hold that&nbsp; ritualized my severence.<br>
&nbsp;</i></div>
    <blockquote class="gmail_quote" 
    style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
        <p><i>I wonder if there is some way you can become really<br>
        free of it by integrating your past with your present <br>
        practice. Sometimes the parts of ourselves we try to<br>
        bury become part of our &quot;shadow&quot; and come back with a<br>
        vengeance.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <div>
        <i><br>
        &nbsp;</i><p><i>Some relationships can be left to die their own, natural 
        death. Others we <br>
        need to actively sever, such as when one seeks a divorce. In Heathenry,
        <br>
        oaths and vows are considered quite important, and I felt that I could 
        not <br>
        pursue my spiritual path without nullifying my previous oath. How else
        <br>
        could the Aesir take me seriously?<br>
        <br>
        And this is not burying. This an open declaration to myself, my 
        ancestors, <br>
        my spirit helpers, that I am embarking on a different path. To me, 
        burying <br>
        would be what you have described, to walk away without acknowledging 
        that I <br>
        was altering my course, my relationships, my spirituality.<span 
        class="q"><br>
        <br>
        Best wishes to you on your new path...<br>
        <br>
        </span>Thanks. I hope you find blessings in yours.<br>
&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p><i>I want to stress, this posting of my ritual has nothing to do with 
        anyone but me.&nbsp; I don't expect anyone to follow suit, nor do I want 
        to launch a campaign.&nbsp; I share it in case it is useful to someone.</i></p>

<p>What it means, to me, to be Heathen</p>
<p>I have been circling this point for a long time, just not realizing what was 
calling to me, within myself.</p>
<p>I left Christianity because my own experience was so destructive, 
repetitively so.&nbsp; A major problem, for me, was the abdication of personal 
responsibility, replacing one's own choices about spiritual expression with the 
pastor or church's choices.&nbsp; The individual has to take responsibility for 
their sins, but only in a way which keeps them under the thumb of the 
organization.</p>
<p>I read about witchcraft and Wicca when I was in my 20s.&nbsp; There's a lot 
of information out there, and no set standard.&nbsp; I was attracted to the 
personal power, skeptical of some of the claims, offended by some stances on 
morals, and, undoubtedly too close to my Christian upbringing to avoid feeling 
frightened that I was doing something truly evil just by reading about it.</p>
<p>I also dabbled in Buddhism.&nbsp; For 15 months, with the encouragement of an 
older sister I idolized, I participated in a Zendo, and even attended a 4 day 
Sesshin.&nbsp; I came to realize that I had, again, substituted someone else's 
spirituality for my own, and decided I would keep searching until I could be 
sure I was doing what I wanted.</p>
<p>For a good stretch, about 15 years or more, I participated nominally in 
Catholicism.&nbsp; At this time, I continued to read historical books regarding 
the Christian religion.&nbsp; My first two children were baptized in the 
Catholic Church, because I was persuaded by my husband's reasoning that it is 
part of our culture, and it would hurt his parents to not do so.&nbsp; I was 
internally conflicted, as well, feeling it would just be easier, for the sake of 
getting along, if I embraced it, especially because I know so many people who 
are nominal, and one religion is just as good as another.&nbsp; (Or so I 
reasoned)</p>
<p>I tried for a time, when my daughter was small, to go to church at least once 
a month.&nbsp; It's very trying, to take a little kid, and not really get 
anything out of it yourself.&nbsp; And since George absolutely refused, I quit.</p>
<p>In early 2003, we were in, again, a tough financial place.&nbsp; I was very 
frustrated as a mom, trying to balance finances, motherhood, my confusion 
regarding religion/spirituality/ethics/intuition.&nbsp; While unemployed, I 
began visiting websites regarding Traditional Paganism, Witchcraft, and some 
shamanistically oriented sites.</p>
<p>In May of 2003, I surprised myself entirely, by recommitting my life to 
Christ. (I suspect I had scared myself by looking so seriously at paganism and 
witchcraft.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, I went to an Orthodox Church, and 
was so moved by the artwork and music I became convinced that this was the 
experience I was looking for, the picture that tied all the Christian pieces 
together for me.&nbsp; It had touched on the mystical/shamanistic I thought I 
was looking for.</p>
<p>It lasted for about 3 very intense months.&nbsp; During that time, I tried to 
be as structured as my childhood was, even compulsive.&nbsp; Gradually I began 
to recover some emotions tied to my family, and very early childhood, before 
Vatican II really took effect.&nbsp; I began to see that I was recreating my 
childhood so that I could face some issues, and heal.&nbsp; I also became 
increasingly disturbed at the dichotomy between what I was experiencing in my 
own heart during Liturgical services, vs. the self-righteousness, rigidity, and 
arrogance of the community of believers around me.</p>
<p>I woke up one morning completely done with it.&nbsp; And frustrated with 
myself.</p>
<p>I then embarked on the same quest, from a different angle.&nbsp; I reasoned 
that I had often had quite remarkable self-revelations by tapping into my own 
subconscious mind, so I sought to alter my consciousness and get feedback from 
my deepest self.&nbsp; I also decided to try to determine the most natural human 
tendencies regarding spirituality, what elements seem to be evident throughout 
time and space.</p>
<p>Ultimately I stumbled onto the Shamanism Board at Beliefnet.com.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Many people are very familiar with Christian history and writings, but a 
surprising number of people who call themselves Christian actually know very 
little about the origins of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not fair to say the &quot;origins', because every religion has been 
begot to some extent by those that came before.</p>
<p>One thing that traditional mainstream Protestants may be unaware of is the 
wealth of literature that exists that was not accepted by what came to be the 
Church of the Eastern/Western Roman Empire.&nbsp; I was going to put a few links 
here, but realized the reader can search Google as well as I.&nbsp; Very few 
books actually made it into the canon, and there were a large variety of sects 
and interpretations regarding who Jesus was, what he taught, and what it meant 
to be a Christian.</p>
<p>The first literature that&nbsp; was written down by Christians were the 
epistles, some of which came to be incorporated into the New Testament.&nbsp; 
These began to be circulated between 50-70 AD.&nbsp; There were also pre-gospel 
texts being circulated around the same time.&nbsp; Closer to the turn of the 
first century, gospels began to be written regarding the birth, life, and death 
of Jesus.&nbsp; There are no corroborating sources of Jesus' historical 
existence outside of Christian literature. There is a very interesting
<a href="http://www.jesuspuzzle.com/">website</a> out there about how this 
religion may have come into being <i>without</i> the physical reality of Jesus 
of Nazareth.</p>
<p>The second century saw a more active struggle for control over the official 
doctrine.&nbsp; Many teachings were circulated, those of Origen, Tertullian, and 
the Manicheans and other forms of Gnosticism, to name a very few.&nbsp; Again, 
this isn't a treatise, and you can find this information at your local library 
or on the Internet.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/nicene381.html">
Nicene Creed </a>was formulated in 325 AD, and most of mainstream Christianity 
adheres to it's basic principles.&nbsp; The exception, is that the Eastern 
Orthodox Churches object to the following line:</p>
<p align="center">We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Churches believe that both the Son and the Holy Spirit proceed 
from the Father, who is the fountainhead of the Trinity.</p>
<p>I stop here, because I wanted to establish that Christianity has <i>never</i> 
been a united religion in which all Christians understood, believed and 
practiced the same thing.&nbsp; It was in the 4th century that it became 
formulated, and those who considered themselves with the most political power 
declared those who did not accept their canon and interpretation as being 
&quot;heretics&quot;.&nbsp; It was around this time that the Eastern Churches began to see 
themselves as teaching &quot;Orthodox&quot; teachings, or &quot;right teachings&quot;, and that 
those outside of their interpretation were supposedly in error.</p>
<p>Many people have been influenced, for good or evil, by teachings of this 
religion, but it has always been evolving and open to personal experience and 
interpretation.&nbsp; As individuals, we are free to read, learn, interpret, and 
practice, according to the Spirit's revelation to us.</p>

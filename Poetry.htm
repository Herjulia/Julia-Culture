<p>04/19/06</p>
<p>First offering to Odin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>On Fear</b></p>
<p>I told Greybeard I was afraid of him</p>
<p>He says I'm afraid of me</p>
<p>Of my own berserker</p>
<p>Of inspiration</p>
<p>Of doing something different</p>
<p>Maybe that's why they call him Wise.</p>

<p>04/26/06</p>
<p><b>Echos of Voices</b><br>
<br>
Voices whisper<br>
Reverberate<br>
&quot;Awake, awake!<br>
Rise and greet us,<br>
Rise and play!&quot;<br>
<br>
I answer their call<br>
My life is renewed<br>
Joy and contentment<br>
Grow, at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****** try again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eerie whispers</p>
<p>Calling to me</p>
<p>&quot;Hear us, awake</p>
<p>Open your heart</p>
<p>See what we see.</p>
<p>Only then, do my eyes open</p>
<p>Frightened no more.</p>
<p>Voices comfort, encourage, </p>
<p>Instigate new searching.</p>
<p>Carefree, I play with my friends</p>
<p>Evergreen, this new heart</p>
<p>Sated with joy.</p>
<p>05/03/2006</p>
<p>Night, I breathe you<br>
Bathe in you<br>
Pale Manni smiling<br>
On us Lovers<br>
Inspiration<br>
Reunite me with myself</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Lately I've been feeling</p>
<p>Ill at ease with my surroundings</p>
<p>Knowledge from my blood</p>
<p>Enveloping my thoughts</p>
<p>Always an outsider</p>
<p>Belonging, now, to Earth</p>
<p>Lost no longer</p>
<p>Embraced by myself</p>
<p>*******<br>
<br>
Unknown Date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trees</p>
<p>How weird, one solitary tree.</p>
<p>Trees are what forests are made of</p>
<p>Looking up, the canopy dense, blocking the sky</p>
<p>Masses of roots, below the ground, grafting</p>
<p>We are people of the trees </p>
<p>connected, rooted, our souls one biomass</p>
<p>Reaching up, above the foliage</p>
<p>To clean, pure air above.</p>
<p>**************************</p>
<p>3/13/06</p>
<p>Justice</p>
<p>Not just for everyone BUT me</p>
<p>To learn to be just to myself</p>
<p>To learn to be just myself</p>
<p>To extend it</p>
<p>To stand on IT</p>
<p>TRANSITIONING</p>
<p>On a hill, looking over the lay of the land</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see overconsumption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see avarice, and ego.</p>
<p>This lack of connectedness to self, to each other, to Earth and the Web of 
Wyrd.</p>
<p>Healthcare won't change from within.</p>
<p>The people must want connectedness.</p>
<p>When they are spiritually connected, they will find wholeness.</p>
<p>I must go about my mundane role, growing a garden, a few kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding peace in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding joy in it.</p>
<p>This is my answer:&nbsp; </p>
<p>UNPLUG.</p>
<p>05/10/06</p>
<p>(Daisy chain practice)</p>
<p>when new weird dew wends silently yawning 'gainst the evening grade ever 
reaching gladly yet terrible even now when nothing goes safely ----</p>
<p>Last word</p>
<p>Well</p>
<p>Emptied and echoing</p>
<p>Ancient armor crashing as it falls</p>
<p>Silence, then</p>
<p>Shame for the fool</p>
<p>Horns in the distance</p>
<p>Fly, heroes, fly</p>
<p>They're coming!</p>
<p>******************</p>
<p>I'd like to replace the lyrics of &quot;A Mighty Fortress&quot;, for several reasons:</p>
<p>It meant a lot to me growing up, and I think it would be good to have new 
lyrics</p>
<p>It's a good German bar song, as I understand it, so it would be appropriate 
to restore the tune to it's roots.</p>
<p>So here I begin:</p>
<p>4 Stanzas</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 About how strong god is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 About not standing on our own strength, ID JXT as the 
source of strength</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp; About who we're up against</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 About how JXT will triumph, and the bounty that he'll 
give his followers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>05/20/06</p>
<p>So a rewrite would have</p>
<p>1&nbsp; In praise of our Gods/desses</p>
<p>2&nbsp; About our own strength</p>
<p>3&nbsp; About the state of the world</p>
<p>4&nbsp; About the gifts we have as Asatruar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ONE</p>
<p>These Gods are great because they are the Gods of my ancestors</p>
<p>Deeds:&nbsp; Odin's sacrifices: hanging on the tree for the runes, losing his 
eye for foreknowledge</p>
<p>Thor's strength and use of Mjollnir, his protection of mankind</p>
<p>Tyr's sacrifice of his hand for the sake of the Aesir</p>
<p>Frigga's knowledge and teaching us weaving crafts, and frith</p>
<p>Freya</p>
<p>Freyr</p>
<p>TWO</p>
<p>physical strength</p>
<p>strength as a people</p>
<p>laws coming from the bottom up</p>
<p>magic, healing, herbal knowledge</p>
<p>THREE</p>
<p>nature is neither good nor bad</p>
<p>our fate is in our own hands</p>
<p>FOUR</p>
<p>Runes</p>
<p>Seidr Work</p>
<p>Lore</p>
<p>Kindred</p>
<p>FolkSoul</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Haven't posted since the New Year!&nbsp; Been spending too much time on B Net.</p>

<p>
Lots going on.&nbsp; I have been spending time on the Shamanism board, reading 
and posting.&nbsp; A good group of people over there:&nbsp; very respectful, 
informed, and mostly don't get their feelings hurt too easily.</p>

<p>
Found out I'm pregnant for our third kid.&nbsp; Surprised, but not displeased.&nbsp; 
Very tired at 40 (minus 3 days), but other than that, ready to expand the family 
a little.&nbsp; No more after this, though LOL!</p>

<p>
DH suggested I start sort of a catalogue of my religious and spiritual studies, 
and I think I might be ready to hunker down and do it.</p>

<p>
So my basic areas of interest are:</p>

<p>
Buddhism:&nbsp; I spent about a year and a half as part of a Zen group, and I 
still find a lot of appeal in Buddhism.&nbsp; I want to get a lot more knowledge 
of the different forms of Buddhism.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.georgehernandez.com/wwwJH/2004Christianity.htm">Christianity</a>:&nbsp; I want to explore non-traditional forms as well as those 
basically adhering to the Nicene Creed.</p>

<p>
Heathenism:&nbsp; I've found an interesting spirit in this Northern European 
Paganism, an attitude that doesn't apologize constantly, and doesn't get it's 
feelings hurt.&nbsp; I like not walking on eggshells.</p>

<p>
Shamanism:&nbsp; Not technically a religion, but a set of practices aimed at 
getting connected to the web of life.&nbsp; It can be found within most of these 
other religions.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.georgehernandez.com/wwwJH/2004Witchcraft.htm">Witchcraft</a>:&nbsp; This is hard to nail down.&nbsp; I think there are as many 
forms of witchcraft as there are people who practice it, but I will start to 
describe what I see as the main features.</p>

<p>
I better get crackin', huh?</p>

    other texts that date as far back as what is accepted by &quot;mainstream&quot; 
    christianity that is accepted in part by several of them.&nbsp; Just because 
    those with political power at the time declared certain teachings to be 
    heretical doesn't mean they were right, and there still are many groups who 
    worship Jesus Christ who probably can't say the Nicene Creed.&nbsp; The Catholic, 
    Orthodox, and Protestants would most likely categorize them as cults, but 
    only God can judge that.</font></em></div>

<p><b>Tiredness and Witchcraft</b></p>
<p>Profoundly tired today, and I guess sort of struggling with sleepiness and 
negative energy.</p>
<p>Whenever I come across new ideas, especially religious ones, I get 
enthusiastic, and I like to experiment.&nbsp; Problem is, whenever I reach the 
inevitable &quot;coming back to earth&quot;, I feel like I must be nothing more than a 
fluff, and no one will take me seriously.</p>
<p>I really want wisdom.&nbsp; I'm not looking for the &quot;feel good&quot; route, and I 
certainly don't think buying a bunch of religious &quot;stuff&quot; is going to get me 
where I want to go. </p>
<p>It's just I keep realizing that I get going on pretty superficial data, at 
least outside of Christianity.&nbsp; I don't want to deceive myself into believing I 
know something I don't.</p>
<p>But this is good.&nbsp; This is the spur that keeps me searching.</p>
<p>I've been revisiting a website that I was quite moved by last year or more, 
and you can read more about it under the Witchcraft link below.&nbsp; Basically,
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wv/clanndroen/hallpage.html">Robin Artisson</a>, 
has many very informative ideas about Traditional Witchcraft, Wicca, and 
European Paganism.&nbsp; I begin my cataloging today</p>

<h2>
<b>Mystery</b></h2>

<p>
Some of the information on the
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wv/clanndroen/hallpage.html">Scarespite</a> 
website by Robin Artisson got me wondering about the Eucharist, and other sacred 
meals that some religions might practice.&nbsp; My hunt lead me into exploring 
ancient Mystery Religions, which happen to have many similarities to 
Christianity.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
I do read books--but websites are so much&nbsp; more accessible.&nbsp; One that 
gave a lot of good information about the Mystery Religions is here:
<a href="http://webpages.charter.net/djhalnon/mystrel.html">Christianity &amp; the 
&quot;Mystery Religions&quot;</a>&nbsp; .&nbsp; This gentlemen has a lot of Christian and 
Medieval history information.&nbsp; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. , also wrote a 
paper on this subject,
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/vol1/500215-The_Influence_of_the_Mystery_Religions_on_Christianity.htm">
The Influence of the Mystery Religions on Christianity</a>&nbsp; .&nbsp; And for 
a view that has nothing to do with Christianity,
<a href="http://www.belinus.co.uk/mythology/Mysteryreligions.htm">Mystery 
Religions Page</a> .</p>

<p>
Basically, many of these secret religions predated Christianity by thousands of 
years, and its clear they influenced the Christian faith.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>
Spiritual paths and the mindset that follows</h2>

<p>
The one thing I have found all spiritual paths seem to have in common, is that 
whether the adherents acknowledge it or not, they think they have the edge on 
spiritual truth.&nbsp; Even those who proclaim vehemently that they have nothing 
against other religions or spiritual traditions, or that there path is not 
religious, just spiritual, and that they are open to the spiritual experience of 
any person.&nbsp; If you start talking to them, before long, it will become 
apparent that they view you as needing to be brought up to speed on &quot;real&quot; 
spiritual wisdom, and that it can <i>really</i> be found by doing what they do.</p>

<p>
I guess by wandering around and asking a lot of questions, I always feel like my 
point of view is open to debate.&nbsp; I hope that feeling keeps me from this 
kind of spiritual arrogance.&nbsp; I hope it keeps me able to hear wise words 
when they are offered, no matter who they come from.&nbsp; </p>

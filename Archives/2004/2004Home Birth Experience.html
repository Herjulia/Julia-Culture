<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">Home Birth</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">It isn't as bad as it's
opponents would have you think.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">It isn't as glorious as it's
proponents would have you think.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">After being a Respiratory
Therapist for 9 years, I was very aware of how our medical community
can exaggerate situations at times.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong; medical
science has advanced healthcare in a multitude of ways.&nbsp; And when
it is implemented with a scientific attitude, it can be a great thing.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">But when it's implemented in the
following ways, it goes awry: For ego-- whether doctor, nurse, RT, or
whoever, thinking they are personally responsible for the outcome of
each medical situation; For teaching purposes--the moments when the
decision to perform a procedure is influenced by the need to train a
resident in that procedure, rather than it's true necessity; For
pharmaceutical or equipment testing, exploration, justification--when
we become fascinated with all of our various modalities, and the
control we imagine we have, or are influenced by their advertising and
economic needs to implement their products; For the adrenaline
rush--medical people often thrive on stress, and a certain traumatic
air, and at times, we create those situations by our mentality, and
sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">So I investigated home
birthing.&nbsp; I knew several women over the years who had great
things to say about their home birth experience.&nbsp; I read several
books, looked at what the World Health Organization has to say about
birthing, and interviewed probably 5 women who have had multiple home
births.&nbsp; Asked a lot of questions of my certified nurse midwives
regarding medical situations I had witnessed in birth, and was
satisfied with how they said they would handle these outcomes.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">Connie Marie was born at home
after 60 hours of labor, 5 hours of pushing, and probably about a 500cc
blood loss.&nbsp; It was back labor:&nbsp; I spent probably 2 solid
days feeling like I was being crushed in a garbage truck.&nbsp; People
say "Why didn't you go to the hospital after labor wasn't
progressing?"&nbsp; Well, one, my midwives kept assuring me that I was
going to deliver very soon; two, the thought of getting into an
ambulance and riding seemed like it would be too painful (I know, when
you're rational, you're thinking how could it really have been MORE
painful?); three, I know the medical community, and they have their own
prejudices--I didn't want to deal with them trying to "fix" what I had
"screwed up", or subconsciously punish me for making what they would
consider bad medical choices.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">I started my child's infancy off
with absolutely no energy to give her.&nbsp; She had colic, I struggled
through breastfeeding, and was profoundly depressed.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">York Joseph was born in an
absolutely wonderful hospital, Annapolis Hospital in Wayne, MI.&nbsp;
It's a little community hospital, and apparently only one team that can
do epidurals.&nbsp; They were in a C-section when I was delivering, so
I was given a narcotic called Stadol.&nbsp; I hallucinated during the
delivery, screamed my fool head off, saw Noah's ark and his animals
running around while I was trying to have a baby.&nbsp; After delivery,
I had no trouble nursing, and the baby was not obtunded in any way. The
nursing staff was supportive, not controlling.&nbsp; They really
respected what I was aiming at, and were there for me, but also gave me
a lot of space.</p>
<p style="font-family: comic sans ms;">Hallucinating beat the hell out
of home birthing.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, I'm Julia.&nbsp;
Welcome to my Web Site.</b></p>
<p>I am a woman, 42, Midwestern American.&nbsp; My three children are small, of 
mixed Filipino-Northern European stock.&nbsp; I am one of the fortunate to be 
in a committed relationship with their father, who is a wonderful husband, dad, 
and person.</p>
<p>I am a licensed respiratory therapist, and have worked in hospitals since 
1986.</p>
<p><i>Changing My Worldview</i></p>
<p>I am actively engaged in changing my worldview.&nbsp; To me, what this means 
is that, as I consider or embrace a new element in my life, I look at the 
context in which I am changing it.&nbsp; Whether philosophical, ethical, 
spiritual, scientific, physical, I want to take the old view or habit in its 
context, consider whether the new element is compatible and why.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't have a laundry list.&nbsp; What I do have are certain areas of angst 
in my life.&nbsp; In the past I was trying to change my habits by simply 
plugging the new habits into my old worldview.&nbsp; That method has really not 
worked for me.</p>
<p>About three years ago, my change in world view took on a more conscious 
activity.&nbsp; I began to realize to what extent I was out of harmony with my 
own heart and soul.&nbsp; It was amazing, really, as I had always thought I was 
quite independent. But I found I was consistently stuffing my very soul down in 
order to please those around me.</p>

<p>
I have sort of my own curriculum going, of topics I want to learn about.&nbsp; 
I'm going to start developing an outline.</p>


<p>
<b>Herbalism</b>:</p>


<p>
I am currently using the home study course from
<a href="http://www.planetherbs.com/">Planet Herbs</a>, a web site developed by 
Michael Tierra and his wife, Lesley.&nbsp; </p>


<p>
I believe that healthcare, to be sustainable, must turn back to the individual.&nbsp; 
We need to take responsibility for eating right, exercising, maintaining our 
psycho/spiritual balance, and treating ourselves for the most common, 
non-emergency, non-life threatening issues.&nbsp; New evidence is coming forth, 
that the majority of medicines are in &quot;weeds&quot; within a few hundred feet of most 
people's homes.&nbsp; We need to return to the old knowledge that our ancestors 
knew.</p>


<p>
<b><a href="../../2006Permaculture%20Studies.htm">Permaculture:</a></b></p>


<p>
I first heard this word on NPR, describing a backyard garden that could be left 
for up to 2 weeks with no intervention.&nbsp; It was in the desert.&nbsp; </p>


<p>
<i>Permaculture:&nbsp; </i>A contraction of the words &quot;permanent&quot; and either 
&quot;agriculture&quot; or just &quot;culture&quot;.&nbsp; The idea&nbsp; all about sustainability.</p>


<p>
Some concepts that are included or related as far as gardening goes are 
&quot;Woodland gardening&quot;, &quot;Forest gardening&quot;, &quot;edible landscaping&quot;.</p>


<p>
I've been wanting to implement these principles, but was living in an apartment 
up until last summer.&nbsp; This year, we're going to plant a few annual 
vegetables for fun, but the BIG thing, is to design an edible landscape, and 
begin addressing our soil and water situation.</p>


<p>
But this is my vision:</p>


<p>
Although I live in a major urban center, I want to get off the grid.&nbsp; 
Wherever possible, I want to generate our own energy, rely on our own water 
cycle, and generate/eat our own food.&nbsp; I hope to develop a cottage industry 
from our produce.</p>


<p>
Although I haven't posted my links yet, just use your search engine of choice, 
and you can find out a TON of stuff on the internet.</p>


<p>
<b>Integrative Medicine:&nbsp; </b>this is a term referring to blending 
allopathic and alternative care, rather than choosing one or the other.</p>


<p>
My first step is going to be taking some CEUs on an integrative approach to 
asthma.&nbsp; As a respiratory therapist, it seems a good place to start, if I 
think I might blend my current profession with a new direction.</p>


<p>
<b>Asian and European Martial Arts:</b></p>


<p>
I stopped studying Shotokan karate during my 12 week of pregnancy for my first 
child, after 6 years of study.&nbsp; I occasionally do a little on my own, 
knowing enough to practice technique, and try to get a little conditioning.&nbsp; 
However, last Saturday I took my first class in Medieval LongSword, after much 
prompting from my husband.&nbsp; Not only do I think the aerobic pace is, at 
least currently, more where I am at in my unfit, middle-aged body, but the upper 
arm work will be great.&nbsp; I was also quite surprised at how natural the 
sword seemed to move in my hands.</p>


<p>
<b>Northern Heathenry (Asatru):</b></p>


<p>
I am Heathen.&nbsp; What this means is that I embrace, practice, and am 
learning, as much as I can of the reconstructed/revived religion of my Northern 
European ancestors.&nbsp; April 28th is my first anniversary.&nbsp; Currently, I 
am trying to establish the habit of reading each day from the Icelanding Eddas, 
which are the surviving texts of the mythology and lore of the Germanic peoples.&nbsp; 
I am also engaging in as much study as I can of the mythology, archeology, and 
other literature that will elucidate what kind of lives my ancestors lived.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Heathen Beginnings</b></p>


<p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy Heathen Birthday to 
me--April 28, 2006!</b></p>


<blockquote>


<p>
I began a journal on April 29, 2005, after realizing I was on a Heathen path.&nbsp; 
This was something that took around three years to develop, as I explored 
shamanism, witchcraft, reconstruction, non-orthodox Christianities.&nbsp; The 
day I declared myself to myself, I basically just <i>realized</i> it, rather 
than making some sort of decision.&nbsp; I hope to use this place to grow, and 
share the richness of this spiritual tradition.</p>


<p>
<b>Spiritual Divorce</b></p>


<p>
On February 9,2006, I to formally ended my relationship with the Desert God.&nbsp; 
You may view my ritual <a href="../../20060209.htm">here</a> .&nbsp; To some who've 
read this, it was beautiful; to some, maudlin.&nbsp; All I can say is that it 
has been deeply healing and freeing.&nbsp; I truly feel a new person.</p>

<p>
<b>Current Diety</b></p>


<p>I am implementing a study plan where I focus on one Norse deity at a time.&nbsp; 
My original plan was one per month, but I'm finding even that a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Although, I want to do a simple review here, a jumping off point to be a little 
familiar, and later return for more in depth study.&nbsp; Like, have a habit of 
exploring each deity in a revolving order, returning for a more in depth round 
after completing each one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is my past work on this: </p>
<p><b>Tyr</b></p>
<p>I have not begun reading too much of Tyr.&nbsp; He's just sort of come to 
mind lately, and I've offered a few prayers to him for insight into justice.</p>
<p>He is either Odin's son, or that of the giant Hymir.&nbsp; Originally, he was 
the god of battle, but made way for Odin to become the god of battle during 
viking times.</p>
<p>His attribute is a spear, and he is shown one handed, his right having been 
bitten off when he gave it in pledge to the Fenris Wolf, placing it in his mouth 
so he would submit to being leashed.</p>
<p>His role in Ragnarok will be to kill the hound Garm, but he will die in this 
battle.</p>
<p>He is the most bold or gods, inspiring courage and heroism in battle.</p>
<p>I'll link to the <a href="http://www.thetroth.org/resources/william/tyr.html">
Tyr and Zisa</a> (Tyr's consort) article on the Troth, for further study.</p>
<p>From that article:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><i>But the real mystery embodied in this story lies only partially in Týr's 
act, which is readily comprehensible in human terms. Týr's relationship with the 
wolf adds a far deeper and more complex aspect to the myth. Whether Fenrir 
represents cosmic chaos and destruction, as some theorize, or violence and 
greed, which Týr also in some sense bound in the Þing, the striking element of 
the story is that Týr seemed actually to have been friends with the wolf. 
Whatever it was about Fenrir's nature that so terrified the other gods seems 
almost to have struck a chord in Týr. A mere god of law and order would not have 
reacted in that way. Only a god fully cognizant of the necessary part that chaos 
and destruction play in the cosmos, and in his own nature, would have </i><em>
fed </em><i>that chaos and destruction, knowing that it must bring the end of 
all the god himself works to preserve. Although Týr plays a decisive part--</i><em>the
</em><i>decisive part--in binding the destructive forces that threaten the 
worlds, he nonetheless does so from a viewpoint that acknowledges and respects 
those forces, and that identifies with the totality of being and of Wyrd, rather 
than his own role in Wyrd's working out. Týr is thus the warrior, the constant 
star impassively recording the warrior's deed, and the universal axis of being 
and destiny that joins the two and gives them meaning, </i><cite>Irminsul.</cite><i> 
In Týr's defining act, the warrior, the master of struggle presiding over the 
great Þing of life, and the universal, boundless and transcendent sky become 
one, and we see more clearly than in a thousand etymologies the essential unity 
among the multitude of faces Tiwaz has chosen to show the Indo-European peoples 
over the millennia.</i></p>

<p>K--I'm a mother of three and I work part-time outside the home, so a lot 
of this may come in a sort of digested version, but at least it's a start, and 
if anyone is reading, maybe it will spark their interest as well.</p>

<p><b>Rune Meditations</b></p>
<p>March 5, 2006&nbsp; Fehu:&nbsp; Today, all I can see is a stick figure, 
reaching upward for the sun, the energy that makes it's own fire.</p>




<p>March 24, 2006&nbsp; Uruz:&nbsp; I see a mountain crag, difficult to climb, 
but nearly impenetrable once you get there.&nbsp; A great position to be in, if 
you have the might to climb it.</p>





<p>March 27, 2006&nbsp; Thurisaz:&nbsp; I'm impressed with how erect it is.&nbsp; 
I wonder if you could make it with your hand as a protective gesture?</p>

<h2>
Spiritual &quot;dating&quot;</h2>

<p>
'What?&nbsp; Like &quot;carbon dating&quot;?&nbsp; You want to bring spirituality into 
your dating?&nbsp; I thought you were in a committed relationship?'</p>

<p>
Now simmer down.&nbsp; I had this &quot;aha&quot; moment today, when I realized there is a 
dimension of my spiritual exploration that is like dating.&nbsp; In my case, 
like guys.&nbsp; So I will be adding the &quot;adolescent crush&quot; analysis to the 
cerebral and analytical information on each spiritual topic.</p>

<p>
DISCLAIMER:&nbsp; this part is in no way intended to be prescriptive or to say 
this is how I feel through and through.&nbsp; I'm attempting to extrovert some 
of my sillier and less rational &quot;stuff&quot; so I can get at the core of what I 
really am looking for spiritually.</p>

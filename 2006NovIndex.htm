<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, I'm Julia.&nbsp;
Welcome to my Web Site.</b></p>
<p>I am a woman, 42, Midwestern American.&nbsp; My three children are small, of 
mixed Filipino-Northern European stock.&nbsp;(NOTE:&nbsp; this is the main 
reason things are sporadic, here, and you won't see all of my links up today, 
November 4, 2006.) I am one of the fortunate to be 
in a committed relationship with their father, who is a wonderful husband, dad, 
and person.</p>
<p>I am a licensed respiratory therapist, and have worked in hospitals since 
1986.</p>
<p><i>Changing My Worldview</i></p>
<p>I am actively engaged in changing my worldview.&nbsp; To me, what this means 
is that, as I consider or embrace a new element in my life, I look at the 
context in which I am changing it.&nbsp; Whether philosophical, ethical, 
spiritual, scientific, physical, I want to take the old view or habit in its 
context, consider whether the new element is compatible and why.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't have a laundry list.&nbsp; What I do have are certain areas of angst 
in my life.&nbsp; In the past I was trying to change my habits by simply 
plugging the new habits into my old worldview.&nbsp; That method has really not 
worked for me.</p>
<p>About three years ago, my change in world view took on a more conscious 
activity.&nbsp; I began to realize to what extent I was out of harmony with my 
own heart and soul.&nbsp; It was amazing, really, as I had always thought I was 
quite independent. But I found I was consistently stuffing my very soul down in 
order to please those around me.</p>

<p>
This was a curriculum of topics that were hot for me for a while. I've archived 
most of what I was working on, and will recreate links to my other thoughts.&nbsp; 
I'm sort of remaking this part of my web page.</p>


<p>
<b>Herbalism</b>:</p>


<p>
I believe that healthcare, to be sustainable, must turn back to the individual.&nbsp; 
We need to take responsibility for eating right, exercising, maintaining our 
psycho/spiritual balance, and treating ourselves for the most common, 
non-emergency, non-life threatening issues.&nbsp; New evidence is coming forth, 
that the majority of medicines are in &quot;weeds&quot; within a few hundred feet of most 
people's homes.&nbsp; We need to return to the old knowledge that our ancestors 
knew.</p>

<b><a href="2006Permaculture%20Studies.htm">Permaculture:</a></b></p>


<p>
I first heard this word on NPR, describing a backyard garden that could be left 
for up to 2 weeks with no intervention.&nbsp; It was in the desert.&nbsp; </p>


<p>
<b>Integrative Medicine:&nbsp; </b>this is a term referring to blending 
allopathic and alternative care, rather than choosing one or the other.</p>


<p>
My first step is going to be taking some CEUs on an integrative approach to 
asthma.&nbsp; As a respiratory therapist, it seems a good place to start, if I 
think I might blend my current profession with a new direction.</p>


<p>
<b>Asian and European Martial Arts:</b></p>


<p>
I stopped studying Shotokan karate during my 12 week of pregnancy for my first 
child, after 6 years of study.&nbsp; I occasionally do a little on my own, 
knowing enough to practice technique, and try to get a little conditioning.&nbsp; 
Last Spring I took and introductory class in Medieval LongSword, after much 
prompting from my husband.&nbsp; Definitely a great workout, and very 
interesting.&nbsp; I joked with the Chicago Swordplay Guild members that this 
was where &quot;Geek meets Jock&quot;.&nbsp; </p>


<p>
However, for my current interests, I am returning to karate.&nbsp; On September 
8 I just had bunion surgery, 8 weeks out, now, and I want to start Shidokan 
karate at the Chicago Fitness Center.</p>


<p>
<b>Religion/Spirituality/Atheism</b></p>


<p>
My Christian upbringing put me in about every Christian context you can imagine.&nbsp; 
I have done quite a bit of spiritual exploration, most recently, Heathenry (Asatru).</p>


<p>
As much as I want there to be magic, answered prayer, direct contact with a 
god/goddess or other sort of Deity-ish thing, I cannot say I've every had any of 
the above.&nbsp; No spiritual type experience I've ever had could be explained 
by anything outside my head.&nbsp; I do believe much has been of value, just as 
far as personal growth; however, I've reached a point where I want things less 
complicated, and it's entirely too much work to keep trying to conjure up faith 
in the supernatural.</p>

<h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666">Hi, I'm Julia.&nbsp;
Welcome to my Web Site.</font></h2>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">
<br>
If you have visited here before you'll note I changed it from BLOG to
Web Site.&nbsp; The reason
is this: as a part-time respiratory therapist and a full-time mother
of two (soon to be three) I do not have time to do a daily or even
weekly update.<br>
<br>
Recently I've decided to really commit to this site, though, as a
repository for my own education.&nbsp; Perhaps you will find it useful
as well.&nbsp; I'm working on the internal links, as well as trying to
warm it up a bit for visual appeal.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">A
basic idea of who I am and why I'm writing this:&nbsp; I'm having
something my hubby likes to call a mid-life growth spurt, finally
getting to the guts of what's been eating me.&nbsp; This applies
especially to spirituality--so I am exploring a great deal, and dumping
my ideas here.</font></p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">He he.&nbsp; Baby is 9 1/2 months old, and I have 
definitely decided on a Heathen path.&nbsp; I was looking at the humility stuff 
I wrote farther down, and, well, let's just say I am going to respond to myself 
before long.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basically I've been making this triangular 
exploration: Shamanism, Heathenry, Witchcraft--although mostly 
Shamanism/Heathenry.&nbsp; Then a little historical Christianity here and there, 
as I try to understand the context I am in.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We close on our first house in a few days.&nbsp; I 
invoked Frigga to help us, and boy did she deliver!&nbsp; We only went out once, 
found a gut rehab, all new appliances, marked at a rock bottom price.&nbsp; Good 
neighborhood, not too far west.&nbsp; Central air, cable ready, all the old 
lead-based stuff taken out.&nbsp; Back yard a little wild looking.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Thursday we close, and I have a frankincense 
candle for greeting and warding the land, and rose incense and sage incense to 
claim and ward the house.&nbsp; I am working on my rite of land and hometaking.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have contacted some local Heathens to learn 
from, and befriend.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666">Wisdom Walk<br>
</font>
</h2>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">07/26/2004
8:51 AM</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I
have been doing some thinking about spirituality as a "path of
wisdom".&nbsp; So I decided to hash out some of my own ideas about
wisdom.<br>
I would define wisdom as a humble, compassionate, insightful
intelligence.&nbsp; Webster's dictionary defines it as "soundness of
judgment", but I think that the soundness comes from the other three
components I've included in my definition.&nbsp; Allow me to expound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why is humility important?<br>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">First,
another definition.&nbsp; From the American Heritage Dictionary, the
first definition is what I'd like to describe: "Marked by meekness or
modesty in behavior, attitude, or spirit; not arrogant or prideful."<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Or
my own:&nbsp; an honest and accurate self-evaluation.&nbsp; I am
not describing a servile or weak attitude here;&nbsp; I believe someone
can make significant "boasts" and still be humble if the boast is an
accurate description of their skill or self.&nbsp; And this would also
exclude a false humility, that would downgrade one's talents in order
to maintain an outward appearance of meekness, or to avoid taking on
the actions or discipline that talent might demand.<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The
opposite, of course, would be any inaccurate, dishonest, or
blurred self-evaluation.&nbsp; I seen these conditions as a problem
because they are weak.&nbsp; As I mentioned, if we engage in false
humility, we don't live up to our potential.&nbsp; If we engage in
arrogance, we are blind to our faults, and that is where another can
take advantage of us, or we get blindsided by events in our lives.<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why is compassion important?</span><br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I
begin by defining my terms again.&nbsp; "Deep awareness of the
suffering of another coupled with the wish to relieve it. ", is the
definition given in the American Heritage Dictionary.&nbsp; Mine is a
definition that I think sprouts from humility--the forgiving of other's
weaknesses because you know your own frailty.&nbsp; I see compassion as
being a little more mundane, rather than waiting for deep
suffering.&nbsp; Compassion is roused when we see other's simple
struggles, as well as when something tragic happens.<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why
is that important to wisdom?&nbsp; It allows for connection and
harmony with other spirits.&nbsp; It inspires cooperative effort. It
opens us to learning from others, directly.&nbsp; And it opens us to
learning by entering into their suffering.<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why is insight important?<br>
&nbsp;</span><br>
More from American Heritage: "<br>
</font>
</p>
<ol>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> <li><font
 face="Comic Sans MS">The capacity to discern the true nature of a
situation;
penetration.</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Comic Sans MS">The act or outcome of grasping the
inward or hidden nature of
things or of perceiving in an intuitive manner."</font></li>
  </font>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I
like them both, and don't need to add anything.&nbsp; But why is it
important?&nbsp; Again, the more blind we are, the less likely we are
to base our actions on a solid foundation, the more likely to stumble.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lastly, intelligence.</span><br>
<br>
Of course.&nbsp; What would wisdom be without facts, details, reality,
to frame our decisions around?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So what would a wisdom walk look like?</span><br>
<br>
A path of wisdom would increase humility, compassion, insight, and
intelligence.&nbsp; But how would you go about doing it?<br>
<br>
It seems to me that to develop humility means, not merely taking a
lesser role sometimes, but also testing our limits.&nbsp; What other
way to discover our capabilities or boundaries, than by pushing
ourselves to where we can no longer perform?&nbsp; Often we are tempted
to avoid an activity because we don't think we would be good at it, but
this is pride, the fear of failing.&nbsp; Failing is good, because then
we know where we are at.<br>
<br>
Compassion for me has been aroused most often when I choose to rub
elbows with those who suffer.&nbsp; I am not talking about becoming the
support for every needy person who comes along.&nbsp; But for instance,
in a role as a respiratory therapist working in a hospital, I have good
boundaries, but am interacting with people in their suffering.&nbsp;
This could be done in any setting, provided you decided to take on the
mindset of identifying with the people around you, listening to them,
and wondering what you would feel like.&nbsp; Allowing yourself to be
affected by their troubles, at least to some degree.&nbsp; Keep the
boundaries, but remember your frailty and at least feel for others.<br>
<br>
Insight comes to us naturally sometimes, but can be cultivated through
meditation, reflection, journaling, pondering, and debating, to name a
few activities.&nbsp; For me, discussion groups online are extremely
helpful, as others bring in perspectives I just don't come up with on
my own.&nbsp; Again, sometimes we avoid these "conflicts" because they
make us uncomfortable, but that goes back to humility and the need to
push our limits.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to look like a fool if you stand
to gain more insight.<br>
<br>
Lastly, intelligence.&nbsp; How often do we formulate an opinion
without putting in the legwork of actually studying the subject?&nbsp;
It's easy to do, and at least in America, all too prevalant.&nbsp; I
have noticed among the pagan community a great emphasis on scholarship,
and I am excited and inspired by it.&nbsp; So find the facts you can,
and see what you can verify or prove.&nbsp; Temper it by understanding
it's limitations, applying it by identifying with others, and penetrate
beyond it's surface.<br>

<h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666">Spiritual "dating"</font></h2>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">08/11/2004
07:58 AM -0500</font><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'What?&nbsp;
Like "carbon dating"?&nbsp; You want to bring spirituality
into your dating?&nbsp; I thought you were in a committed relationship?'</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now
simmer down.&nbsp; I had this "aha" moment today, when I realized
there is a dimension of my spiritual exploration that is like
dating.&nbsp; In my case, like guys.&nbsp; So I will be adding the
"adolescent crush" analysis to the cerebral and analytical information
on each spiritual topic.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DISCLAIMER:&nbsp;
this part is in no way intended to be prescriptive or
to say this is how I feel through and through.&nbsp; I'm attempting to
extrovert some of my sillier and less rational "stuff" so I can get at
the core of what I really am looking for spiritually.</font></p>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666">Spiritual paths and the mindset that follows</font></h2>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The
one thing I have found all spiritual paths seem to have in common,
is that whether the adherents acknowledge it or not, they think they
have the edge on spiritual truth.&nbsp; Even those who proclaim
vehemently that they have nothing against other religions or spiritual
traditions, or that there path is not religious, just spiritual, and
that they are open to the spiritual experience of any person.&nbsp; If
you start talking to them, before long, it will become apparent that
they view you as needing to be brought up to speed on "real" spiritual
wisdom, and that it can <i>really</i> be found by doing what they do.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I
guess by wandering around and asking a lot of questions, I always
feel like my point of view is open to debate.&nbsp; I hope that feeling
keeps me from this kind of spiritual arrogance.&nbsp; I hope it keeps
me able to hear wise words when they are offered, no matter who they
come from.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666"><b>Mystery</b></font></h2>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some
of the information on the
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wv/clanndroen/hallpage.html">Scarespite</a>
website by Robin Artisson got me wondering about the Eucharist, and
other sacred meals that some religions might practice.&nbsp; My hunt
lead me into exploring ancient Mystery Religions, which happen to have
many similarities to Christianity.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do
read books--but websites are so much&nbsp; more accessible.&nbsp;
One that gave a lot of good information about the Mystery Religions is
here:
<a href="http://webpages.charter.net/djhalnon/mystrel.html">Christianity
&amp; the "Mystery Religions"</a>&nbsp; .&nbsp; This gentlemen has a
lot of Christian and Medieval history information.&nbsp; Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. , also wrote a paper on this subject,
<a
 href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/vol1/500215-The_Influence_of_the_Mystery_Religions_on_Christianity.htm">The
Influence of the Mystery Religions on Christianity</a>&nbsp; .&nbsp;
And for a view that has nothing to do with Christianity,
<a href="http://www.belinus.co.uk/mythology/Mysteryreligions.htm">Mystery
Religions Page</a> .</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basically,
many of these secret religions predated Christianity by
thousands of years, and its clear they influenced the Christian
faith.&nbsp; </font></p>

What
constitutes God's Word has been debated for centuries.&nbsp; The Jews
do not accept the Christian Canon, Orthodox and Catholic, not to

plethera of epistles, gospels and other texts that date as far back as
what is accepted by "mainstream" christianity that is accepted in part
by several of them.&nbsp; Just because those with political power at
the time declared certain teachings to be heretical doesn't mean they
were right, and there still are many groups who worship Jesus Christ
who probably can't say the Nicene Creed.&nbsp; The Catholic, Orthodox,

<h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666"><b>My areas of spiritual
interest</b></font></h2>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">DH
suggested I start sort of a catalogue of my religious and spiritual
studies, and I think I might be ready to hunker down and do it. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So
my basic areas of interest are:</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buddhism:&nbsp;
I spent about a year and a half as part of a Zen group,
and I still find a lot of appeal in Buddhism.&nbsp; I want to get a lot
more knowledge of the different forms of Buddhism.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><a
 href="http://www.georgehernandez.com/wwwJH/2004Christianity.htm">Christianity</a>:&nbsp;
I want to explore non-traditional forms as well as those basically
adhering to the Nicene Creed.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heathenism:&nbsp;
I've found an interesting spirit in this Northern
European Paganism, an attitude that doesn't apologize constantly, and
doesn't get it's feelings hurt.&nbsp; I like not walking on eggshells.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shamanism:&nbsp;
Not technically a religion, but a set of practices
aimed at getting connected to the web of life.&nbsp; It can be found
within most of these other religions.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><a
 href="http://www.georgehernandez.com/wwwJH/2004Witchcraft.htm">Witchcraft</a>:&nbsp;
This is hard to nail down.&nbsp; I think there are as many forms of
witchcraft as there are people who practice it, but I will start to
describe what I see as the main features.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I
better get crackin', huh?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">

</p>
<h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666"><b>My Own, SuperImportant,
AllEncompassing definition of
Spirituality</b></font></h2>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"> "We
are all spiritual beings.&nbsp; For me,
spirituality is the combination of our bodies, minds, and subconscious,
and whatever state these currently are in.&nbsp; This definition
acknowledges the innate spirituality of anyone, from sage to psychotic,
from infant to octogenarian. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"To me, the highest
purpose in any religion is to harmonize our spirituality.&nbsp; I
believe we are at peace when we don't dissociate our minds from our
bodies, or from our subconscious.&nbsp; This is why running, dancing,
or martial arts, are often described by participants in spiritual
terms, because when they perform these activities they experience
harmony of mind, body, and spirit.&nbsp; Singing can also do this, art,
and sometimes writing. (Though for me, writing tends to get me very
analytical sometimes.)&nbsp; This is why I think ritual is important,
and when done with the intent for this kind of self-integration. Ritual
taps the subconscious in the same way that art does, bringing
subconscious thought into concrete action.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The problem with religion
is when it gets politicized.&nbsp; Anytime a practice, revelatory text,
or spiritual&nbsp; concept become the 'property' of an elite group, who
define themselves as the keepers of it, or prescribe how it should be
implemented or interpreted, and by whom, it becomes politicized.&nbsp;
And all too often, those elite incite their followers through
xenophobia in order to perpetuate their own politico-religious
structure.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"So two destructive
phenomenon result:&nbsp; First, individuals begin to look to something
outside themselves for spiritual validation, and become more and more
disconnected from their innate spirituality.&nbsp; Second, society
becomes dissociated from this harmony, and fails to listen to the
wisdom that comes naturally to us all."<br>
</font></p>
<h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006666">Polytheism</font></h2>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">
<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Man,
I guess I'm all over the place with this religion stuff.&nbsp;
The History of Pagan Europe really ignited my thinking.&nbsp; In the
past, I always bought into what I was raised with, the idea that Roman,
Greek, and Norse mythology is just a collection of stories and legends,
but the Bible, now that's real.&nbsp; And also, that it is silly to
believe in many gods, because to be God, one has to be all knowing, all
powerful, yada yada .....</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So
this obvious thought got through my thick skull:&nbsp; why is it
superior to believe that One God is mysteriously manifest in Three
Persons, but not that One God is mysteriously manifest in a multitude
of deities, or even, in human vs. animal manifestation?&nbsp; So I
realized that there is nothing superior to it, and that Christianity is
<i>not</i> a monotheistic religion.&nbsp; (I know, any Jews reading
this want to knock me upside the head--"what do you think we've been
saying. . .")</font></p>

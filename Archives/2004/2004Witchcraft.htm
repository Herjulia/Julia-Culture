<p>I began reading a little about Wicca in the 1980's, as I was losing my 
enchantment with Christianity, and I stopped participating in Buddhism.&nbsp; At 
that time, I read &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; by Margot Adler, and &quot;The Spiral 
Dance&quot; by Starhawk.</p>
<p>Initially, I was just trying to &quot;de-prejudice&quot; myself.&nbsp; After all, 
Christians had done a lot of damage to me, so why should I take at face value 
what they had to say about witches?&nbsp; For a while I was interested in 
finding a coven, but it proved to be typical of my enthusiastic bursts.&nbsp; 
Also, because I had spent my adolescence in a group that rivaled The Branch 
Davidians, I decided I just wasn't ready for groups.</p>
<p>In the last 5 years or so, I have had an increasing longing to adjust my 
lifestyle to my spirit.&nbsp; I feel that we live so divorced from our 
intuition, and bodies, and our work usually pits us against our families.&nbsp; 
Somewhere in the midst of this search for a more &quot;organic&quot; life, I was exploring 
permaculture, and started stumbling onto more and more sites by Pagans and 
Witches.</p>
<p>During that time, I came across the works of Robin Artisson, and saw for the 
first time, a connection between Native American ways of relating to nature and 
Spirit, and that of the Northern Europeans.&nbsp; I am not saying they are one 
and the same!!&nbsp; But the first time, I saw a primitive, natural, 
spirituality in witchcraft, and I grew fond of this.</p>
<p>Basically, Wicca is currently a variety of eclectic groups that incorporate 
influences from a variety of western and eastern influences.&nbsp; Without a 
doubt, there are those who call themselves Wiccan who are deeply spiritual, and 
sincere.&nbsp; However, this religion, or collection of religions, has been 
heavily marketed, and watered down, so you might have to exercise a lot of 
wisdom, and wade through a lot of garbage to get to the good stuff.&nbsp; You 
might also waste a lot of money to get to the good stuff.&nbsp; For myself, most 
of these groups are more structured than I am personally interested in.</p>
<p>Witchcraft is hard to nail down, and I will leave it to Mr. Artisson to 
explain more fully.&nbsp; Basically, there is less structure, and more oral 
tradition.&nbsp; These traditions can trace their lineage to times as far back 
as the 17th century, but not before. </p>
<p>I have been on a few discussion groups, trying to talk to witches, and I have 
to say, they have been hard to carry on discussions with.&nbsp; It seems I have 
to define everything, and often I am warned about possibly offending people by 
the choice of this or that word.&nbsp; So for now, I am putting my energy into 
web sites and books, and will wait to see if I ever get a straight answer on 
anything from a practicing witch.</p>
<p>I want to add more links, but right at this time, I would just be copying the 
links of others without checking out the sites, so it will wait for another 
time.</p>

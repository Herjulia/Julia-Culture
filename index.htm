		<p>I'm a now 50 year old Midwestern American, and it's been 9 years since I first published this page. My three children are no longer small, but are still of mixed Filipino-Northern European stock. I am one of the fortunate to be in a committed relationship with their father, who is a wonderful husband, dad, and person.</p>
		<p>I have worked in hospitals since 1986, as a patient referral coordinator, circulator/transporter/dark room tech for radiology, unit coordinator for a birthing center, respiratory therapist, and EMR analyst.</p>

		<h1>Health Care</h1>
		  <p>In our society, most of us get our medical advice from doctors.  And proceed to ignore it.</p>
		  <p>I'm not a doctor.  I started working in hospitals in 1986, originally transporting patients back and forth from radiology to other areas of the hospital.  I also worked in the darkroom.  Later, when I entered school for respiratory therapy, I worked for a while as a unit secretary.</p>
		  <p>To the average person, only doctors and nurses work in the hospital. If you are heavily influenced by television, you think nurses are always women, and usually either drill seargent types or sex kittens.  Doctors do all the important stuff, and nurses change bedpans.</p>
		  <p>I'm not going to bother trying to fix your perceptions...just note that what I said above is a stereotype...and pretty offensive.  Next time you are introduced to any medical person, you would benefit from knowing more, so ask them about the nature of what they do in the hospital.</p>
		  <p>I worked as a respiratory therapist for a cumulative total of approximately 13 years.  I got to see how amazing our technology is.  I also got to see that we haven't caught up with it ethically.  We don't understand yet, as a society, that just because we <i>can</i> do something doesn't mean it's a good idea.</p>
		  <p>If you don't know it yet, there is a lot of tension between Western medicine and Alternative or Complementary Medicine.  I am not well versed in the many alternatives out there, but I've developed a few opinions about how we approach health in our society, and how we could do it better.</p>

		  <h1>Herbs</h1>
			<p>I mentioned that there is a divide between Western medicine and Alternative medicine.</p>
			<p>I think it's funny when doctors or "scientist" claim that herbs don't work.  We would never have gone down the path of pharmaceuticals if we hadn't believed in the efficacy of medicinal plants.  The problem is, in Western societies, the tradition of mentorship from herbalist to budding practitioner has been mostly lost.  People pick up their "knowledge" of herbs from the "guy who works at the food co-op", without investigating what his credentials are.  The companies that sell "herbs" go out and grab the whole plant, regardless of it's maturity, and grind it up and sell it, without any sensitivity to <i>which part of the plant</i> is actually supposed to be used for the desired effect.  People of Western orientation continue to approach their own health as if they can "plug and play" between pharmaceuticals and herbs, without taking responsibility for maintaining the proper diet, exercise, or hygeine routines.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Western doctors evaluate the efficacy of herbalism according to the approach of Western medicine, which wants very much for you to buy their products of pharmaceuticals, diagnostic procedures, and surgeries.  There is no comparison between these two systems...if you embrace herbs for treatment, you should be prepared to take much more responsibility for preventing illness, and be prepared for slow action on these herbs, rather than the "magic bullet" offered by concentrated pharmaceuticals.  The upside is you will (if you proceed intelligently) avoid the toxicity, and preserve the microbiome.</p>
			<p>One more thing: companies selling nutritional supplements are not necessarily any more ethical than big pharma.  If you don't know how to grow or forage your own herbs, or prepare them, you should research the source of your medicine carefully, regardless of whether they claim to be "all natural" or not.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section1">
			<h1>Religion and Philosophy</h1>
			  <p>My background is pretty complicated as far as religion goes.  I was raised, originally, as a tradiional post Vatican II Catholic.  My parents took on "supplemental" practices, and I wound up being influenced (heavily) by Fundamentalist Christianity and the Charistmatic Movement</p>
			  <p>It was not a positive experience.</p>
			  <p>As an adult I have spent 18 months meditating with a Zen center, a couple years exploring Shamanic journeying, and interspersing this with swings back toward Catholicism, exploring Christian Orthodoxy, Norse Mythology, and European Paganism.  I have not found anything I believe more than what is tangible.  Somewhere around 2009 I was introduced to Marcus Aurelius' <i>Meditations</i>, and I've found the most satsifaction with approaching problems from a Stoic perspective.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section1">
			<h1>Permaculture</h1>
			  <p>Permaculture is a science and ethical system, aimed at working with Nature to change the way we do pretty much everything.  It was originally a way to approach agriculture, but has evolved into a system to make a "permanent culture".  The goal is to build a social structure that respects the earth and all of it's enhabitants, and restores what it takes.</p>

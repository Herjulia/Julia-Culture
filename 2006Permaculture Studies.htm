<p>
I first heard this word on NPR, describing a backyard garden that could be left 
for up to 2 weeks with no intervention.&nbsp; It was in the desert.&nbsp; </p>


<p>
<i>Permaculture:&nbsp; </i>A contraction of the words &quot;permanent&quot; and either 
&quot;agriculture&quot; or just &quot;culture&quot;.&nbsp; The idea&nbsp; all about sustainability.</p>


<p>
Some concepts that are included or related as far as gardening goes are 
&quot;Woodland gardening&quot;, &quot;Forest gardening&quot;, &quot;edible landscaping&quot;.</p>


<p>
I've been wanting to implement these principles, but was living in an apartment 
up until last summer.&nbsp; This year, we're going to plant a few annual 
vegetables for fun, but the BIG thing, is to design an edible landscape, and 
begin addressing our soil and water situation.</p>


<p>
But this is my vision:</p>


<p>
Although I live in a major urban center, I want to get off the grid.&nbsp; 
Wherever possible, I want to generate our own energy, rely on our own water 
cycle, and generate/eat our own food.&nbsp; I hope to develop a cottage industry 
from our produce.</p>


<p>
Although I haven't posted my links yet, just use your search engine of choice, 
and you can find out a TON of stuff on the internet.</p>

<p>
Someone has suggested I look up SPIN farming.</p>


<p>
SPIN:&nbsp; S-mall P-lot IN-tensive farming</p>


<p>
Basics:</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Uses sub acre farm, 1000 ft or half an acre</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; You can affordably rent, rather than own a small 
appropriate lot.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Can be used in rural, suburban, or city setting.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Can fit into any lifestyle.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.somertontanksfarm.org/about/spin.shtml">Somerton Farms</a> 
is the US test farm for this method.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; It's possible to produce $50,000 of produce.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; It's organic--can micromanage for cleanliness and 
reuse.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


<p>
<i>This is where I'm at as far as the yard and urban agriculture:</i></p>


<p>
1.&nbsp; Have been reading a lot of links and articles, and finished Gaia's 
Garden by Toby Hemenway.&nbsp; (will link when I have time).</p>


<p>
2.&nbsp; Suspect that the 70 foot high silver maple has to go.</p>


<p>
3.&nbsp; Suspect we may have lead in the soil, and intend to have it tested.</p>


<p>
4.&nbsp; Trying to decide if we should remove the top layer, due to glass and 
debris and possibility of lead.</p>


<p>
5.&nbsp; Tentative plan:</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Year One:</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Replace front, back gates.&nbsp; 
Place gate in gangway to enclose dog.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Break up concrete, rearrange it to 
make a patio, and reroute the path.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Probably remove Maple.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Plant nitrogen fixers and nutrient 
accumulators.&nbsp; Plan to pull them up in the fall, because they probably will 
be lead contaminated.&nbsp; Also, not recycling the grass.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Begin composting.&nbsp; Plan on 
mulching and composting to rebuild soil.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Container gardening for tomatoes, 
herbs.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Year Two:</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Contouring the land, creating 
swales, ground storage for water.&nbsp; Of course, recycling rainwater.&nbsp; 
Perhaps create a greywater recycling system.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Heavy duty sheet mulching, like, a 
foot deep.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -New trees--small fruit or nut, 
possibly an evergreen.&nbsp; I think ComEd recommends something on the NorthWest 
side, to protect from winter wind.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Yew or juniper, or both, in the 
front yard.&nbsp; Wintergreen for ground cover.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Plant new round of nitrogen fixers 
and nutrient accumulators.&nbsp; May pull these up also, not sure if the lead 
will be gone.</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -More container gardening.</p>

<p>I am going to outline this lay because I am studying Thor, I am considering 
writing children's stories about the lore, and because it's a really funny 
story.</p>
<p><u>Summary</u>--Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, is stolen, and he and Loki connive to 
retrieve it.</p>
<p><u>Some Kennings</u>: Vingthor (consecration Thor); Fjorgyn's first-born,</p>
<p><u>About Mjolnir</u>:&nbsp; &quot;The Crusher&quot;, never misses it's aim, and always 
returns to Thor's hands.</p>
<p><i>The Story</i></p>
<p>Thor was angry when he awoke to find his hammer, Mjolnir, missing.&nbsp; He 
began to shake, then fumbled around.</p>
<p>&quot;Loki!&quot;, he shouted.&nbsp; &quot;Loki, my hammer is stolen!&quot;</p>
<p>Loki agreed to go with him to Freya's bower.&nbsp; Thor hoped Freya would 
loan him her feather coat, so he could fly and look for his hammer.</p>
<p>They met Freya.&nbsp; &quot;Will you lend me your feather coat, so I can find my 
hammer quickly?&quot;</p>
<p>Freya was generous with her coat.&nbsp; &quot;Even if it were made of gold or 
silver, because you ask, Thor, I will give it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Loki donned the feather coat, and flew far beyond the halls of the gods, to 
the lands of the giants.&nbsp; He found Thrym, the Lord of the thurses, sitting 
on a mound.&nbsp; He was making golden leashes for his dogs, and was sleeking 
his horses manes.</p>

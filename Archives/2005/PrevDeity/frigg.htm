<p><b>Frigg&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>I begin here, because the Wife of Odin (that's a &quot;kenning&quot;, or another or a 
&quot;poetic name for&quot; Frigg) is a wife and mother, and much of what I already know 
of her is part of my own spiritual ideal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frigg is, as mentioned, Odin's wife, counterpart, equal.&nbsp; 
She is the keeper of her house, and promotes domestic tranquility.&nbsp; She 
knows and spins fate, but tells no one what she knows.&nbsp; She is the Mother 
of the God Baldr, and tried to prevent his death by going throughout the world 
and extracting a promise from&nbsp; every creature not to harm him.&nbsp; But 
she overlooked the mistletoe, and it was through this being that Baldr is 
killed.&nbsp; So she is a weeping mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her home is called &quot;Fensilar&quot;, or &quot;marsh-halls&quot;, and has 
many handmaidens who are also goddesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Old Norse it is Frigg, Anglo-Saxon Frige, Old High 
German Frija, Wagnerian Fricka.&nbsp; It isn't clear to me where Frigga comes 
from.&nbsp; I guess I'll just stick with Frigg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; References from the Lore</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the &quot;Lokesanna&quot;, the trickster god Loki is giving all 
the gods &quot;what for&quot;, pointing out there flaws or apparent flaws.&nbsp; He 
accuses Frigg of infidelity with Odin's brothers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, she 
doesn't exactly refute him, but simply says &quot;If Baldr were here, he'd make you 
pay&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the &quot;Grimnismal&quot;, Odin and Frigg together foster two 
brothers, Odin Geirroth, and Frigg Agnar.&nbsp; Geirroth tricks Agnar out of his 
inheritance, and the two deities take sides. (No, I'm not retelling the story.&nbsp; 
I'm referencing the Lore--for myself, for future study. I told you I had kids, 
right?)</p>

<p><b>Odin</b></p>
<p>This is just a little UPG (Unverified Personal Gnosis).</p>
<p>The first few days I began reading about Allfather, I had sort of a little 
talk with him.&nbsp; It began with me acknowledging to him that I was sort of 
cowardly when it comes to thinking of interacting with him.&nbsp; The 
&quot;conversation&quot; took turns that I did not expect, leading from my supposed fear 
of him, to realizing I was afraid of what he might evoke in myself, or that in 
myself which is like him.</p>
<p>For a couple of years now, I keep hearing inner statements that I must give 
in to my &quot;Inner Witch&quot;, or that I need to give myself permission to go crazy.&nbsp; 
The conversation was along those lines.&nbsp; That I need the ecstatic in myself 
to be fulfilled spiritually, and that I need the berserker in myself to protect 
my family and keep it safe.</p>
<p>All the same, I doubt that I am Valhalla material.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>God of death and battle, magic, runes, poetry, and wisdom.&nbsp; His name in 
Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon means &quot;madness, fury, inspiration&quot;.&nbsp; He is the 
leader of the Wild Hunt through winter nights, bestowing 
gifts on those who deserve it, and punishment to those who deserve it.</p>
<p>References from the lore</p>
<p>Yikes, bit off much more than I can chew, here!&nbsp; The one perhaps best 
known is &quot;The Havamal&quot;, or &quot;sayings of Har&quot;, another name for Odin.&nbsp; This 
is a book of wisdom.</p>
<p>Kennings</p>
<p>There are so many, but this first struck me, in light of the above UPG--</p>
<p>Haptsönir.........&quot;Fetter Loosener&quot;&nbsp; My experience completely felt like 
he's trying to enlighten and unloosen me.</p>
<p>Yet--</p>
<p>Hrammi.........&quot;Fetterer&quot; or &quot;Ripper&quot; --is another, like an eagle gripping 
it's prey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this is very superficial, but I'm moving on.&nbsp; It's intended to 
just get me acquainted, so I begin to know whom I'm talking about when I read.</p>
<p>Oh, and originally I was going to blot each God/dess, but as I'm growing in 
my understanding of this word, let's just say I'd like to be more careful, not 
hasty.</p>
<p><b>Thor</b></p>
<p>Thor is the God of Thunder, Warder of Midgard and Asgard.&nbsp; Usually not 
shown as sharp-witted as Odin or Loki, he is practical, and his solutions to 
problems show common sense.&nbsp; Many places throughout Northern Europe bear 
his name, demonstrating how widely worshipped he was.&nbsp; As God of both 
Thunder and Rain, he was considered a great friend to man. He is protector and 
hallower, having one heiti, Véurr, &quot;he that makes sacred&quot;.</p>
<p>Mjollnir is his hammer,&nbsp; used to fight giants, as well as hallow brides 
and funeral pyres.&nbsp; It is widely worn by Heathens today as a sign of troth.</p>
<p>Big and muscular, with red beard and hair, and fiery eyes, the Thunder God 
drives a wagon drawn by Tanngrisnir and Tannnjoster, and is seen today as the 
protector of his Mother, Earth (Jord, the giantess).</p>
<p>Donar (early Germanic), Thunar (Anglo-Saxon)</p>

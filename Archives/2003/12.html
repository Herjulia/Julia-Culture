<p><b><font size="4">My </font><font size="4">unconversion</font></b></p>
<p>Good morning.&nbsp; My kids are asleep. . .I think.&nbsp; We'll see
how long this lasts.</p>
<p>What a weird year for me!&nbsp; What a rich year!&nbsp; I was raised
with a variety of Christian influences, being raised Catholic, having
parents who got heavily involved in the Charismatic Movement of the
1970s, being dragged into a Para church organization that resembled the
Branch Davidians, then went to a Christian Fundamentalist High School
(this was my own 16 year old choice, based on the warped religious
ideas I was immersed in).</p>
<p>Post high school I started to explore my own ideas, and rejected the
degree of fundamentalism I was influenced by.&nbsp; I explored
Buddhism--for a short time even sought to be a student of
<a href="http://www.inthelight.co.nz/spirit/gurus/kaple001.htm">Roshi
Philip Kapleau</a> (Zen: Dawn in the West; The Three Pillars of Zen); I
read Drawing Down the Moon by Margot Adler, and Spiral Dance by
StarHawk.&nbsp; I also immersed myself in Church History, from both
Church and secular sources.</p>
<p>For 17 years I struggled with guilt, wanting Christianity to be
true.&nbsp; Then this past May, I recommitted my life to Christ.&nbsp;
I read the Bible daily and kept a spiritual journal.&nbsp; I believed
that the apostolic churches were the only ones that demonstrated a
historical connection and continuity between the apostles and
today.&nbsp; I spent about two months going to an Antiochian Orthodox
Church, and sought spiritual guidance from a local Orthodox
priest.&nbsp; I was certain that I was going to convert, and was eager
to absorb as much Orthodox teaching as I could.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the content and type of rituals I was being exposed
to were bringing up feelings and memories, and I realized I was
recreating some aspects of my earlier childhood, so that I could begin
a healing process.&nbsp; After really acknowledging some intense rage I
had toward different events in my childhood, I woke up one morning
"done" with the Christian "thing".</p>
<p>No one could have been more bewildered by this than I!&nbsp; I took
my journaling/devotions time, and researched the writing of
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/2528/russell.htm">Bertrand
Russell</a>, and read
<a href="http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/Paine/AOR-Frame.html">The
Age of Reason by Thomas Paine</a>.&nbsp; After that, I started
exploring
<a href="http://www.jesuspuzzle.com/">The Jesus Puzzle</a>.</p>
<p>I have been recently getting into Belief.net, asking questions about
prayer/meditation/spellwork, and about spirit guides.&nbsp; I also read
different articles on a variety of religious ideas and
traditions.&nbsp; I have also been reading
<a

History or Pagan Europe</a>, by Prudence Jones and
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nigelpennick/outdex.html">Nigel
Pennick</a>.</p>
<p>I am really freeing myself from a lot of fetters, and I have never
felt so young.</p>

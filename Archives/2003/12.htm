<p><b><font size="4">My </font><font size="4">unconversion</font></b></p>
<p>Good morning.&nbsp; My kids are asleep. . .I think.&nbsp; We'll see
how long this lasts.</p>
<p>What a weird year for me!&nbsp; What a rich year!&nbsp; I was raised
with a variety of Christian influences, being raised Catholic, having
parents who got heavily involved in the Charismatic Movement of the
1970s, being dragged into a Para church organization that resembled the
Branch Davidians, then went to a Christian Fundamentalist High School
(this was my own 16 year old choice, based on the warped religious
ideas I was immersed in).</p>
<p>Post high school I started to explore my own ideas, and rejected the
degree of fundamentalism I was influenced by.&nbsp; I explored
Buddhism--for a short time even sought to be a student of
<a href="http://www.inthelight.co.nz/spirit/gurus/kaple001.htm">Roshi
Philip Kapleau</a> (Zen: Dawn in the West; The Three Pillars of Zen); I
read Drawing Down the Moon by Margot Adler, and Spiral Dance by
StarHawk.&nbsp; I also immersed myself in Church History, from both
Church and secular sources.</p>
<p>For 17 years I struggled with guilt, wanting Christianity to be
true.&nbsp; Then this past May, I recommitted my life to Christ.&nbsp;
I read the Bible daily and kept a spiritual journal.&nbsp; I believed
that the apostolic churches were the only ones that demonstrated a
historical connection and continuity between the apostles and
today.&nbsp; I spent about two months going to an Antiochian Orthodox
Church, and sought spiritual guidance from a local Orthodox
priest.&nbsp; I was certain that I was going to convert, and was eager
to absorb as much Orthodox teaching as I could.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the content and type of rituals I was being exposed
to were bringing up feelings and memories, and I realized I was
recreating some aspects of my earlier childhood, so that I could begin
a healing process.&nbsp; After really acknowledging some intense rage I
had toward different events in my childhood, I woke up one morning
"done" with the Christian "thing".</p>
<p>No one could have been more bewildered by this than I!&nbsp; I took
my journaling/devotions time, and researched the writing of
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/2528/russell.htm">Bertrand
Russell</a>, and read
<a href="http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/Paine/AOR-Frame.html">The
Age of Reason by Thomas Paine</a>.&nbsp; After that, I started
exploring
<a href="http://www.jesuspuzzle.com/">The Jesus Puzzle</a>.</p>
<p>I have been recently getting into Belief.net, asking questions about
prayer/meditation/spellwork, and about spirit guides.&nbsp; I also read
different articles on a variety of religious ideas and
traditions.&nbsp; I have also been reading
<a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415158044/qid=1070024007/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1543028-1902420?v=glance&amp;s=books">A
History or Pagan Europe</a>, by Prudence Jones and
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/nigelpennick/outdex.html">Nigel
Pennick</a>.</p>
<p>I am really freeing myself from a lot of fetters, and I have never
felt so young.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial Narrow">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are all spiritual
beings.&nbsp; For me, spirituality is the combination of our bodies,
minds, and subconscious, and whatever state these currently are
in.&nbsp; This definition acknowledges the innate spirituality of
anyone, from sage to psychotic, from infant to octogenarian.</font></p>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial Narrow">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To me, the highest
purpose in any religion is to harmonize our spirituality.&nbsp; I
believe we are at peace when we don't dissociate our minds from our
bodies, or from our subconscious.&nbsp; This is why running, dancing,
or martial arts, are often described by participants in spiritual
terms, because when they perform these activities they experience
harmony of mind, body, and spirit.&nbsp; Singing can also do this, art,
and sometimes writing. (Though for me, writing tends to get me very
analytical sometimes.)&nbsp; This is why I think ritual is important,
and when done with the intent for this kind of self-integration. Ritual
taps the subconscious in the same way that art does, bringing
subconscious thought into concrete action.</font></p>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial Narrow">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem with
religion is when it gets politicized.&nbsp; Anytime a practice,
revelatory text, or spiritual&nbsp; concept become the 'property' of an
elite group, who define themselves as the keepers of it, or prescribe
how it should be implemented or interpreted, and by whom, it becomes
politicized.&nbsp; And all too often, those elite incite their
followers through xenophobia in order to perpetuate their own
politico-religious structure.</font></p>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial Narrow">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So two destructive
phenomenon result:&nbsp; First, individuals begin to look to something
outside themselves for spiritual validation, and become more and more
disconnected from their innate spirituality.&nbsp; Second, society
becomes dissociated from this harmony, and fails to listen to the
wisdom that comes naturally to us all."</font></p>

<p>Man, I guess I'm all over the place with this religion stuff.&nbsp;
The History of Pagan Europe really ignited my thinking.&nbsp; In the
past, I always bought into what I was raised with, the idea that Roman,
Greek, and Norse mythology is just a collection of stories and legends,
but the Bible, now that's real.&nbsp; And also, that it is silly to
believe in many gods, because to be God, one has to be all knowing, all
powerful, yada yada .....</p>
<p>
So this obvious thought got through my thick skull:&nbsp; why is it
superior to believe that One God is mysteriously manifest in Three
Persons, but not that One God is mysteriously manifest in a multitude
of deities, or even, in human vs. animal manifestation?&nbsp; So I
realized that there is nothing superior to it, and that Christianity is
<i>not</i> a monotheistic religion.&nbsp; (I know, any Jews reading
this want to knock me upside the head--"what do you think we've been
saying. . .")</p>
<p>
Anyway, this thinking, plus a curiosity about my pre-Christian Northern
European ancestors, has taken me to quite a few Asatru and Northern
Heathenism sites.</p>
<p>
Then a weird thing happened at work.&nbsp; After spending a few minutes
looking at some Heathen sites, and reading a quote from
<a href="http://www.thetroth.org/">The Troth</a>:&nbsp; "The old gods
are calling; to hear their call is a joy, an honor, and also a duty. If
they are calling to you, it is time to take your place among friends
and kin, and bring new honor and strength to our ancient Heathen
faith."&nbsp; After reading this, I got off the Internet, went to
email, then opened the program that does our billing.&nbsp; As I was
logging on, there was a message between the computer address and the
login command:&nbsp; "gl the gods are calling".&nbsp; Could my Admin
accomplish that?&nbsp; I mean, were they watching me, and put that in
the UNIX program when I logged in?&nbsp; Or is it just a message
between the IT guys, and I "coincidentally" came across it.&nbsp; I
suppose I could ask our IT department.<br>

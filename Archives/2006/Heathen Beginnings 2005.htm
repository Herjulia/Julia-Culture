<p>Wow--</p>
<p>What I've accomplished this year</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquired a copy of the Hollander Poetic Edda.&nbsp; I've 
read a good portion of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Met and occasionally get together with local Heathens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frigga honored us in her assistance getting our house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We performed a landtaking, not specifically or ritually 
heathen, but good for our&nbsp; family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created a divorce ritual, which I performed, to end my 
ties to the Desert God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm learning a little about he runes.&nbsp; I 
occasionally, and increasingly, am doing morning offerings.</p>
<p>Where do I want to go--</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want a more regular daily ritual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want more familiarity with the Aesir, and Vanir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to explore more shamanic activities that will 
increase my wisdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to live my instincts, my DNA.</p>

<p>I have decided to commit to a Heathen path.</p>
<p>This will definately be as a solitary for now, although I have contacted the 
local &quot;meet up&quot; group, just for people to rub elbows with.</p>
<p>I should record how I finally have settled on this.</p>
<p>I guess this need was sparked when I first visited ScareSpite. His emphasis 
on the land, and contacting the ancestors within, moved me. </p>
<p>Then of course, I rubbed elbows with the various Heathen on the Bnet 
Shamanism board, and found that I just plain liked talking to them.</p>
<p>But I was weirded out by the god/desses thing, and needed to work through 
that. </p>
<p>And then, there was this journey, where I was told to look to my Roman 
ancestors. After looking into the relationship between Hera and her peacock, I 
thought maybe that's what I was supposed to go for. But I explored a little more 
of Hellenismos, and Religio Roma, and found it to structured, somewhat 
dualistic, and definately too subservient for my tastes. I just couldn't see it, 
and went back in journey to respectfully decline the invitation.</p>
<p>So I was walking last week, and I just knew. I don't know all the lore, I 
don't know even much ritual. I just knew this is so like me I can hardly see it. 
It's so close, I don't realize it's there. I don't know how to put that into 
words. There's a way of life that is IN me, and I'm most in harmony when I'm 
&quot;hanging out&quot; with Heathens.</p>
<p>So I am going to take baby steps, and make my spirituality one with this 
path. And be nourished by it.</p>

<p>A post on Bnet regarding polytheism:</p>

<p>Acyd says:</p>
<p>&quot; As a non-heathen who's participated here often enough I'm wondering how it 
really matters in the end. As I've explored my religious options over the years 
I see all of these dieties as part and parcel, many highways all going in the 
general same direction (like the L.A. freeway network). In the end the outlook 
really is up to the individual and what works best for them as individuals. 
Right? I mean it's good to debate and the question will always be there but is 
there really a right or wrong answer on this one? &quot;</p>
<p>I would think, just as it matters when I go to my work place which doctor or 
nurse or fellow therapist I work with for the day, how I plan to do things, what 
I expect to accomplish, that it matters how I actually see the god/desses. If 
they are separate, distinct individuals, then they have specific 
characteristics, likes, wants, and ways of working.</p>
<p>I hate it at work, when I'm treated like a warm body, just another 
respiratory therapist, doesn't matter what she really excels at, we just want to 
get the job done, not necessarily well, not necessarily beautifully.</p>
<p>I mean, if you took the god/desses as individuals, couldn't your spiritual 
work become an art? Something unique coming from each interaction, because it's 
you and Odin or Frigg or Thor or someone else, understanding each other in 
partnership.</p>
<p>The intimacy would be more powerful.</p>
<p>I think.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I mean, don't you think what they want matters?</p>
<p>It's sort of like a baby, how they relate to their parents as vehicles of 
getting what they want, as opposed to an adult who understands something about 
their parents strengths and weaknesses, and still wants a relationship with them 
anyway.</p>

<p>I get the feel from fellow heathens that as a whole the belief in hard 
polytheism is to unify them in a particular article of belief and not 
necessarily because it is truth.</p>
<p>Religions need to have some form of unifying principles or then it would be a 
collection of people with similar ideas ranging from a million different 
extremes. Christians say that to be Christians you have to believe this, this 
and this about Jesus and the world etc.</p>
<p>However, I am not going to adhere to belief that amy or may not be true, just 
because I wish to be part of some earth-bound &quot;club&quot;. Religion for me is to find 
truth and sometimes that truth is different for other people (i.e. all truth is 
true).</p>
<p>I just think that a safe and comfortable place for me is to say that 'I do 
not know', because that is the truth and until I have been revealed the truth 
about Divine cosmology, I will continue to worship in the way that feels right 
to me. I find it to be honorable to admit ignorance of a particular subject so 
long as you do your best to try to understand.</p>
<p>Anyway: I refuse to believe in polytheism to fit in, but if I happen to find 
out that polytheism is the ultimate reality of divinities, than I will accept 
this new knowledge. Until then though, I do acknowledge the idea of 
compassionate and benevolent entities and even though I may not know them 100% 
in their true form, I still believe that they are worthy of respect, worship and 
honor. Nothing can stop me doing that, and I pray that in their compassion that 
these entites accept my humble worship as flawed or misunderstood as it may be.

<p>Appalachian Lief--</p>
<p>I agree with you. I am postulating, for myself mostly, what would make it 
important to believe in the individual entity, how seeing them as individuals 
would add an entirely different twist to one's spiritual practice.</p>
<p>I suppose the analogy of a baby could be construed as me saying only 
&quot;grownups&quot; view the dieties as individuals, whereas, pantheism is a &quot;baby&quot; view. 
For myself I can see that there might be a growth issue here, as far as judging 
my own personal progress. But analogies are inherently limited, and I would not 
presume to judge the relationships of another to the god/desses, nor where they 
are on their spiritual path.</p>
<p>I currently have no personal thing going on with any diety, although, perhaps 
this morning a door opened for me.</p>
<p>And in my previous religion, I knew many people who insisted on a &quot;personal 
relationship&quot; with their diety, who all seemed to be doing something remarkably 
uniform, without deviating very much at all into anything unique or rich. If 
your background was like mine, you might be very leary of going that route.</p>
<p>I'm just exploring possibilities, not fretting too much about what the next 
guy (you, he he) is doing with his faith.</p>

<p>Beginning the introduction to Snorri's Edda, the Prose Edda.</p>
<p>Monday, May 23, 2005</p>
<p>The history of the Aesir, according to Snorri, is that Thor was from Thrace, 
and a forefather of Odin. Odin moved north and brought the language and laws of 
the Turks with him.</p>
<p>According to Snorri, everything started in Asia, and the word Aesir comes 
from Asia.</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 25, 2005</p>
<p>Beginning Glyndfi's questioning of Harr and the Aesir.</p>
<p>Wednesday, June 01, 2005</p>
<p>I've been reading Snorri--just covered creation of the world, the existance 
of/characteristics of Bifrost, creation of dwarves, the Norns and personal norns.</p>
<p>Then to The Troth, on prayer and the worship of the Aesir/Asynjur.</p>
<b>
<p>A formula for such a prayer could be stated as:</p>
<p>Hail (best-known name), (descriptive epithet),</p>
<p>Child of (parent), lover of (spouse),</p>
<p>You who dwell in (name of hall),</p>
<p>You who (summarize several relevant deeds)</p>
<p>With your (characteristic tool or weapon)</p>
<p>Come swiftly to aid me</p>
<p>As I (summarize problem being addressed).</p>

<p>Freyr is good to call on in financial situation. Tyr is one handed, and 'not 
a reconciler of men'.</p>
<p>Skadi--snowshoes, bow and arrow, huntress. Wife of Njorder, who lived by the 
sea. He was father to Freyr and Freyja .</p>
<p>Freyja--half the dead are hers--call in her for matters of love.</p>
<p>Bragi--eloquence, wisdom, &quot;brag&quot;</p>
<p>Wife is Idunna--the Apples of the god/desses--gives them youth when they grow 
old.</p>
<p>Tyr's hand--</p>
<p>Fenris wolf was the son of Loki and one of the giants--prophecy foretold he 
would be the undoing of the Aesir--they created successively strong chains to 
hold him, each of which broke. Finally they had the dwarves make Gleipnir, but 
Fenris was suspicious. He would only let them try if one of them put their hand 
in his mouth. Tyr was the only one who was willing, and he lost his hand when 
Fenris realized he could not break free.</p>
<p>Monday, June 13, 2005</p>
<p>Beginning w/ Asatru U again, because I went through somewhat superficially 
before.</p>
<p>Also, I'm planning on using The Troth's guide for study in terms of becoming 
an Elder or Godhi (sp?), first for the discipline and depth of the study, and 
next, in case I might actually be able to become a pastoral counselor in a 
hospital for the pagan/heathen community.</p>
<p>And, I want to use my blog to put some of my ideas out there for the public.

I know who I am, the many things of who I am. multi-layered multi-terms from 
places ancestral to my soul and of my body. I also know who I am here, now in 
this place, this continent, that many of my ancestors immigrated to, and that 
others have always been rooted in. I know who I am. I also know where these 
things, these aspects of myself came from.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> a Shaman. At least of sorts, for others have called me that in my 
work for individuals of various communities or for those communities as a whole. 
even now I’ll receive requests for my aid from those who have known me long. 
despite my not living in some places for many years. though almost without fail 
I’ve asked these folks that if they feel a need to label what I do to refer to 
me as a shamanist. and if they'd rather look upon me as a witch, I'm cool with 
that.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> a Spæmadhr, a seeing woman. I have this gift as a heritage of who I 
am, and as part of a continuing weave with those who’ve come before me.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> a Seiðrkhona, a sorceress. I work with spells, I work with forces 
mighty and fierce.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> a Vitki, a Rune Master. I’ve long since allied myself with Runic 
forces and have a fair friendship with these wights.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> a Cunning Woman. Such is how I would have been perceived in Ould 
Britain. I’ve not a doubt that my grandfather, whom I’ve spoken of before on 
these boards, was what would have been known as a Cunning Man. he hid it, did 
this fine man, but the stories of his prescience remain in my kin’s telling. I’m 
unaware if he worked to heal others in life as he does in death. however, I do, 
and so I am a Cunning Woman.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> a Skald, a poetess. which serves me well amongst these other things.<br>
<br>
I <b>am</b> an Artist, which again serves me well amongst these other things.<br>
<br>
when I found this place, this Shamanism forum here on Beliefnet, I did <b>not</b> 
know who I was. oh I knew I was a bit odd and that I’d always been drawn to 
things metaphysical. I read Tarot and worked with Runes. I did a bit of 
spellcasting now and then. I journeyed a bit, though not in the controlled way I 
do now. I had a deep connection to Nature and the Spirits thereof. I knew some 
of who my ancient Goðs were, and that I was of interest to them. I was an Artist 
and I did play with words. but I did not know who I was. now I do. <br>
<br>
I’d like to thank all the people, the spirits, the forces, my guides, my Goðs, 
my allies, and even the learning trials that I’ve encountered these last few 
years that have helped me know who I am. <br>
<br>
I know who I am. amongst my close friends I do refer to myself as a Spæmadhr or 
a Seiðrkhona. or any of the other titles above, except for Shaman. and I’ve come 
to realize that one of the reasons that I’m not comfortable with calling myself 
a Shaman, is that it’s culturally inauthentic for me. in my very diverse linage, 
that term was never used. I realize that Shaman is a term much bastardized in 
the modern Western world. and from that I accept that there will be others who 
claim the term as a title or label for themselves, I am not among them. I <b>am</b> 
all these thing I list above, yet still, I generally refer to myself as a 
Shamanist, or a Shamanic Practitioner. I could call myself anything, though, and 
those I encounter would see me as they see me regardless.<br>
<br>
I know who I am. who are you? you members who post here with such sharing and 
beauty, who are you?<br>

choices, beginning with talking to us.</p>

<p>I'm getting it, lately, the attraction to &quot;witchcraft&quot;. I'm not interested in

the shamanic traditions of the Northern Europeans, and protecting and enriching

<p>Friday, July 22, 2005</p>
<p>Last night, at the full moon, George, Amy, and I did a very simple blessing 
and warding of our property. Tonight we will grill, and complete the blessing of 
our home.</p>
<p>Beginning in the front yard, on the northeast corner, I hailed the Aesir and 
Vanir, and circumnavigated our property, reciting &quot;Welcome all that wish us 
well, all that harms be barred.&quot; We walked up the East border, up the South 
side, down to the ally--I touched the side of the garage, not sure what to do 
there. We walked back up, came along the east border of the garage--southernmost 
on the yard--then walked the northern fenceline. Walking along the western wall 
of the house, I touched the doors with the candle, then brought it center, to 
the base of our silver maple. We blotted to our ancestors, to my elderkin, to 
the filipino gods whose names we don't know. We invited wights from our old land 
to join us if they will, and greeted the wights here. I then buried my Peacock 
feathers with a lock of my hair at the base of the tree. We blotted to our 
ancestors, to my elderkin, to the filipino gods whose names we don't know.</p>
<p>I sort of announced/stated that we would complete the ceremony tomorrow with 
a grill and internal blessing of our home.</p>
<p>My goal, when we get going on the yard and garden, is to put up a wagon drawn 
by a cow, in honor of Jord.</p>
<p>Right now I am going to research what elements I can bring into an altar for 
Frigg, with an offering place for the house wights, and something for the female 
ancestresses as well.</p>

<p>Okay, watched a thing on the SS and Himmler, got a little freaked out. Read a 
little BNet on racism. Came across a statement of belief from Swain Wodening. 
Interesting, because the other day I had sort of a strong UPG on my way to work:</p>
<p>&quot;you are your deeds. you are your words.&quot;</p>
<p>So here's Swain's:</p>
<i>
<p>Thu bist thin daeda. &quot;You are your deeds.&quot; </p>
</i>
<p>Not, &quot;you are your race, or hair color, or breath odor&quot;, or whatever.</p>
<p>Your deeds.</p>
<p>Your words.</p>

<p>Too long. Was in a funk, rational vs. spiritual mind. Over it. :)</p>
<p>There are two kinds of light--the glow that illuminates, and the glare that 
obscures.<br>

<p>&quot;There are two ways to slide easily through life; to believe everything or to 
doubt everything. Both ways save us from thinking.&quot; <br>

<p>Some entries from various notebooks:</p>
<p>10/9</p>
<p>Intuitive/rational</p>
<p>I can agree to disagree within myself.</p>
<p>I'm not an idiot if I don't have all the answers.</p>
<p>The rest of the animal kingdom relies very successfully on instinct. So can 
I.</p>
<p>Atheists don't have all the answers any more than theists do. Apples and 
oranges.</p>
<p>10/13</p>
<p>Frugality--</p>
<p>I need to handle every resource for myself and my family with respect for its 
scarcity, and the impact of its footprint. Each item <u>is</u> money, time, and 
energy. I need to retrain my thinking in this disposable society.</p>
<p>In healthcare, we insist on disposing and not recycling. We dispose because 
we are not fiscally responsible for the impact of our waste. We waste because we 
will not accept the consequences of risk involved in cleaning and reusing.</p>
<p>The imprint of hospitals is enormous. We have to accept the fact it is 
UNACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>Right now, most hospital patients and their families in America, anyway, feel 
there is no price too high to pay for saving someone's life, or staving off 
their death anyway.</p>
<p>But they don't realize there may be alternative to the METHOD of treatment. 
There are alternantive to the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, just some thoughts I've had in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>I've been reading a piece by--Mark Smith?--on changing our thinking as 
heathens. I was wary, still am--I don't want to repeat Community.</p>
<p>But I realized this morning, a lot of what he's encouraging as far as the 
potential of creating intentional communities, are things I LIKED about WOC. I 
miss the involvement in group entertainment, shared work, things like that. I 
liked sharing resources. </p>
<p>One difference, is that heathens are looking to their lore, archeological 
evidence, etc to determine practices and ethical considerations. In WOC we were 
dealing with private revelations and personal gnosis, and individuals abdicating 
their responsibility to the leadership of the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monday, October 24, 2005</p>
<p>I just want to do a little update.</p>
<p>Skaldic Arts Fest was last Saturday, Geo's birthday. At Alchemy Arts, small 
occult bookshop. Not quite big enough for the group, but adequate.</p>
<p>Carolyn commenced with &quot;Come those who would come, Stay those who would stay, 
Go those who would go, in Peace with me and mine.&quot; Then there was some Hailing 
of the Heathens. At his point I think I got sweaty palms, wondering what I was 
getting into, feeling the sense of being out of the mainstream.</p>
<p>But I had committed to it, so I waited, participated. Kids ate too much, Amy 
did a bit of cruising. Geo got into the drumming, as did the kids.</p>
<p>Nothing earthshattering. Nice warm feelings.</p>
<p>I don't know why I feel I have to rush this. It would be good if I didn't rub 
elbows with the whole group again for a while, at least not in a formal God/desses 
praising setting.</p>
<p>Listening to the sample CD right now.</p>
<p>Wednesday, October 26, 2005</p>
<p>On frugality--</p>
<p>So much of what have wanted to practice throughout life, I have put aside for 
other people's expectations, or what i thought was expected of me. </p>
<p>Not even sure how to express the ideas I've been having.</p>
<p>Long has my instinctive self looked to a simpler lifestyle, more frugal, 
closer to the earth--quieter, in rhythm with her, in rhythm with my self, my 
husband, my children. I've wanted to waste less, use more, have a personal 
system that was efficient, giving back what it took.</p>
<p>Long have I felt the conflict within myself in my hospital work. Long have I 
felt the conflict between the corporate world and the needs of my family.</p>
<p>Why have I silenced these inner voices? Why have I let myself be pacified?</p>
<p>Partly, it was too deeply woven with twisted WOC and xenophobic LCS ideas, 
fear of the world, sense that the Rapture was on the way; to be dependent on the 
world was to be in the snare of the devil.</p>
<p>So I thought they were one and the same, xianity and independent living. When 
a xian I fled the world straight into the arms of a more dangerous foe--the 
church, the pastor. I didn't realize that there were other reasons to cultivate 
simplicity.</p>
<p>Gods, I need to think on this more.</p>
<p>Saturday, December 31, 2005</p>
<p>End of 2005. </p>
<p>Amy is asleep, Geo and kids are at King Kong. Facing the end of the year, and 
just cleaning up alittle on the computer.</p>
<p>Not a year of heathenry, but a good 7 months. Feeling good about it.</p>
<p>I've begun blogging about my &quot;Diety of the Month&quot;, but need to get back on 
track with it.</p>
<p>Amy may be awaking.</p>
<p>Friday, January 27, 2006</p>
<p>Amy sleeping. I've been blogging on the deities.</p>
<p>Subtle, this growing spirituality. Maybe a lot more like a baby in the womb. 
I can't see it. I'm not structuring it. I just find thoughts bubbling up from 
within, like the movement of a fetus within.</p>
<p>Why am I running from being a mom? As a kid, I vowed to never be married, 
because I felt guilty about being molested. Growing up, I always pictured myself 
single, or married to someone without children. I didn't babysit, and never saw 
myself as mom material.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted kids. And in work, I gravitated to kids.</p>
<p>But with my own, I feel like I don't have permission to be a full-time mom, 
or am overwhelmed with thinking about planning meals and getting them to eat 
them, or getting organized.</p>
<p>It's too much about me, my fears, my mental limitations.</p>
<p>My personal spirituality is about the hearth. I feel most connected to the 
concept of the family as the center of spiritual life.</p>
<p>But I always run around like the proverbial chicken, thinking I don't have 
what it takes, and how will I ever do it, and all this SHIT!</p>
<p>I was thinking the other day--I've been considering becoming a teacher--and I 
was thinking, whatever I want to do with my life, it's probably already here, 
right under my nose, and I don't see it. Just like how heathenry snuck up on me.</p>
<p>So today, I'm looking at my kids, and it's like I see them for the first 
time. I have three whole persons in my house, who need someone to feed them 
properly, encourage them, help their souls to grow.</p>
<p>This role of motherhood is not the secondary role to my career. This is the 
primary role for all of society. On some deep level, I've bought into the idea 
that this is the boring unimportant stuff. Mother's are impotent people, 
babysitters. The intelligent and powerful people are out there running things.</p>
<p>I wanted to be a therapist because I thought I'd be saving people. Look at 
me, I'm a savior! Over here, I know stuff. I'm important because you rely on me 
for your life.</p>
<p>My ego's really big here, and I can hardly see that either.</p>
<p>I am growing to believe that the survival of our society depends on empowered 
mothers responding to Mother Earth and returning the next generation to a life 
in tune with her.</p>
<p>Definately worth journeying on. Definately worth reflecting on my 
relationship and OPINION of my own mother.</p>
<p>Oh, Regin, help me clear my head of silly notions! Help me value my own 
opinion and insight, and be strong enough to do what is needed for this home 
regardless of the bad press motherhood has.</p>
<p>Help me let go of my pridefulness, and do what is needed for my family.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the fact that maybe part of this decision is simply that 
it is my duty, or that my first duty is to their needs, and the needs of this 
unit.</p>
<p>Mother Frigga, help me.</p>
<p>Tuesday, March 21, 2006</p>
<p>I'm going to start devotionals, for lack of a better word. I have been 
reading, the Lore and other Asatru sources, but I am going to spend some time 
each morning in the Lore.</p>
<p>It's hard, because of the Kennings and such. Hard to keep straight.</p>
<p>Right now I've been reading The Second Lay of Helgi the Hunding-Slayer. Helgi 
has avenged his family by killing King Hundi, and Sigrun the Valkyrie has 
finished questioning him after a cattle raid.</p>
<p>I can tell I need to go back and read the first lay again.</p>
<p>What is sticking with me: this is my first reading about valkyries, and I'm 
sort of confused. I thought Sigrun's father was killed by Helgi--maybe he was 
defended by him? Anyway, I'll start over tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 22, 2006</p>
<p>I want to stop wanting to be Christian.</p>
<p>It's about nostalgia.</p>
<p>It's about belonging to my family.&nbsp; It's about the security of having 
others tell me what to do.</p>
<p>But its painful.</p>
<p>This transition feels, I'm not sure if its pain.&nbsp; Just, that it will 
take a huge effort to get unstuck from my old ways.</p>
<p>I'm stuck, deeply, in the mud.&nbsp; I'm accustomed to doing things this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to a certain extent, I'm just too lazy to want to 
change any of it.</p>
<p>I'm comfortable to a certain extent.</p>
<p>And my angst--maybe it's more &quot;why do I have to do it&quot;, whiney, than real 
inability to&nbsp; make change.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of it is I don't want to be the one to initiate change.&nbsp; 
What if I piss&nbsp; people off?&nbsp; What if it causes me to lose everything?</p>
<p>As if I could fit in less.</p>
<p>As if I could lose more than I have.&nbsp; You can always lose more.</p>
<p>Laziness is also fear.&nbsp; I don't want to take the lead.&nbsp; I don't 
want to stand out in the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is URGENT.&nbsp; WE are reaching CRISIS, with 
pollution, consumption and all their sequelae.&nbsp; It isn't enough to wait for 
technology to save the day, or for someone else to find the answeres.&nbsp; The 
answer is in me makeing a change, todya.&nbsp; Little changes will add up.&nbsp; 
I just need to begin.</p>
<p>There's also , within me, an old vs. new tradition, vs emerging technology 
dillemma.&nbsp; I am looking to older, more primitive cultures because they are 
more in tune with nature.</p>
<p>Thursday, March 23, 2006</p>
<p>Sigrun's father, Hogni, gives her hand to Hothbrodd; she flies to Helgi and 
declares her love for him. Helgi promises to keep and protect her. He gathers a 
fleet, sails too Freka Stone, and makes war upon the sons of Granmar. No one but 
Hogni's son, Dag. He is made to swear oaths to the Volsungs. Sigrun finds 
Hothbrodd on the battlefield.</p>
<p>After telling him he'll never have her, she finds Helgi, who reports on the 
battle, and the losses in her family. He also makes reference to Starkath, who 
continued battling, tho headless.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>I haven't read the end, yet. I wonder if the wisdom of warring for love will 
be questioned. I guess a big part of the struggle here is duty vs personal 
feelings. Also, whether one can deny love, even at great cost. The sacrifice is 
different--he vows to do battle to keep their love, where as in a Christian POV 
they should run away, or really, I guess, do her father's bidding. So here, 
obedience is less important than passion.</p>
<p>Friday, March 24, 2006</p>
<p>Stanza 21 &quot;On the field have fallen by far the most,</p>
<p>slain by the sword, of Sigrun's kinsmen;</p>
<p>in war hast won great woe only,</p>
<p>since strife didst stir 'mong sturdy lords.&quot; </p>
<p>--Helgi</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the same Sinfolti as the Volsung Saga. Good advice in 
stanza 26--be a goatherd, hold a shepherd's staff in your hand, rather than a 
sword.</p>
<p>Stanza 27--Helgi's a man of the sword, not the word.</p>
<p>Saturday, March 25, 2006</p>
<p>Stanza 29, After Dag slays Helgi, he expresses regret at hurting his sister 
Sigrun. But according to their code, he had no choice but to avenge their 
father.</p>
<p>So, s. 30-33 Sigrun curses him.</p>
<p>St 35, Dag gives her weregild. From Wiki--&quot;Weregild was also known to the 
Celts, who called it ericfine in Ireland and galanas in Wales. Other cultures 
had similar customs: eg the Slavonic glowczyzna.&quot; &quot;Man Price&quot;, blood money, the 
payment for taking a life.</p>
<p>St. 36, Vigblaer must be Helgi's horse.</p>
<p>St. 39, the note comments on how Helgi making Hunding a thrall is unbecoming 
of how a hero would treat a fellow combatant slain in battle. Odin made Helgi 
his right hand man.</p>
<p>Through st. 46, Helgi comes back for a visit, calls on Sigrun to come to him, 
and she makes a bed in the harrow.</p>
<p>Sunday, March 26, 2006</p>
<p>So Sigrun spends the night in the mound with Helgi, one last time. In the 
morning, he rides off with his men. Then she returns the following night, but he 
does not.</p>
<p>I see the element that true love know no bounds, no bounds of code, no bounds 
of death. This is not a passionless, death oriented view, but rather passionate.</p>
<p>In Christianity, you deny all, your very self, for Jesus. All selfhood is 
abdicated so that he reigns supreme.</p>
<p>Here, love is acknowledged. No matter the price is so high, what else is 
there to do, when your love is so deep?</p>
<p>A much different mindset than how I was raised. I like this mindset better, 
but know it will take time to retrain my thinking.</p>
<p>Monday, March 27, 2006</p>
<p>Fra dauda Sinfjotla--Sinfjolti's Death</p>
<p>Sinfjolti is--Helgi's elder brother? He loved the same woman as his 
stepmother, Borghild's, brother. He slew his rival, and she poisoned Sinfjolti. 
He had offered her weregild, but she was still angry. She attempted to poison 
him three times, twice he thwarted because he could see the ale was poisoned. 
His father was able to drink poisons, so he drank for him. She offered the 
third, and shamed him into drinking it.</p>
<p>Odin, in disguise, ferries Sinfjolti across a firth.</p>
<p>Sigmund leaves Borghild and Denmark, faring South to Frankland where his own 
realm is. He remarries, Hjordis, who survives him after the battle with the 
Hundings. Their son was Sigurth. After Sigmund's death, she marries Alf, who 
raises their son to be another hero.</p>
<p>Thursday, March 30, 2006</p>
<p>Gripisspa, or the Prophecey of Gripir</p>
<p>I like the author's notes, that this is just a lay to make a sequence. He 
says: &quot;it is a sapless versified excerpt, utterly lacking originality of 
treatment&quot;.</p>
<p>I was reading a little away from the computer, so let's see if I know where 
we are: Sigurth is on his way to get a prophecy from Gripir, his uncle. 
Basically he wants to know things about his own heroism, and death, I think.</p>
<p>St 25, 26 is Gripir pissed Sigurth is insistant?</p>
<p>Sigurth will pledge himself to one woman, but become &quot;ensnared by another.</p>
<p>Friday, March 31, 2006</p>
<p>So the remainder of the lay; Sigurth will woo Brynild on behalf of Gunnar, in 
his guise somehow. Sigurth will wed Guthrun; Gunnar will wed Brynhild. At some 
point, Brynhild will figure it out, and find a way to reek a bloody vengence on 
Sigurth.</p>
<p>Saturday, April 01, 2006</p>
<p>The Lay of Regin</p>
<p>Here we have Sigurth being fostered by a wise, wizard-dwarf, named &quot;Regin&quot;, 
or &quot;Counselor&quot;.</p>
<p>Otr=otter.</p>
<p>Ran--sea goddess</p>
<p>Vathgelmir--a river in hell, anyone in it who lies will stay longer.</p>
<p>St.4 Andvari, salmon-dwarf, tried to keep the &quot;ring of the Niflings&quot; for 
himself when Loki came for his gold. It is a self-renewing ring.</p>
<p>Monday, April 03, 2006</p>
<p>(Connie wanted to talk)</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 05, 2006</p>
<p>RECAP!!!!</p>
<p>Okay--Hreithmar had two sons, Regin and Otr. Regin raised Sigurth (in this 
story), and Otr was killed by the Aesir when in the form of an otter. The 
wereguild was to fill it with gold, which Loki cursed. Hreithmar reluctantly 
accepted it, because he would have refused it if he knew there was a curse 
attached to it.</p>
<p>St. 9--Hreithmar sends Loki away--are dwarves and gods on &quot;equal&quot; footing?</p>
<p>Then the prophecy/curse is fulfilled, because the son Fafnir kills Hreithmar 
for being unwilling to yield the gold.</p>
<p>Thursday, April 06, 2006</p>
<p>Regin is nice to Sigurth, and begins to egg him on to slay Fafnir.</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 11, 2006</p>
<p>An aside from the lore--I guess that the Days of the Week gods undoubtedly 
were the big ones that were revered. So I should pay special attention to 
references in the lore, and getting to know them.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, where is my Chisholm's Eddas, I wonder?</p>
<p>Soooo,</p>
<p>picking up in stanza 14, Fafnir is lying on the Gnita Heath in the shape of a 
dragon, with the Helm of Terror.</p>
<p>From the Viking Answer Lady--</p>
<p><img SRC="../../Image13.gif" width="275" height="275"></p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><b>
<p>The name of this symbol is ægishjálmr, which when literally translated means 
&quot;helm of awe&quot; or &quot;helm of terror&quot;. It is used in various places in the sagas, 
where it can have many other meanings, such as &quot;countenance of terror&quot; or 
&quot;overbearing nature&quot;.</p>
<p>The term ægishjálmr probably did not refer to a real, physical helmet 
originally, but rather originated in the use of a special kind of magic called 
seiðr. Seiðr could be used to affect the mind with forgetfulness, delusion, 
illusion, or fear. The ægishjálmr is a special subset of seiðr magic called 
sjónhverfing, the magical delusion or &quot;deceiving of the sight&quot; where the seið-witch 
affects the minds of others so that they cannot see things as they truly are. 
The role of seiðr in illusion magic is well-documented in the sagas, 
particularly being used to conceal a person from his pursuers. Part of this 
power may have been due to hypnosis, for the seið-witch could be deprived of her 
powers by being deprived of her sight, and the effect faded when the victim left 
the presence of the seið-practitioner.</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Andale Mono" SIZE="3">
<p>St 15, Sigmund is reluctant to accompany Regin on a quest for Fafnir's gold. 
His obligation to avenge his father's death is greater than his need/want for 
gold.</p>
<p>Raevil is a or the Sea King.</p>
<p>St. 17, 18--Odin? comes aboard during a storm while Sigmund is on his way to 
avenge his father.</p>
<p>Monday, April 17, 2006</p>
<p>The Lay of Fafnir</p>
<p>Sigurth jumps into a trench and spears the dragon in the belly.</p>
<p>I'm curious to research dragon lore, because they go back and forth in 
calling him a dragon or a man. </p>
<p>Tuesday, April 18, 2006</p>
<p>Not so much beginnings, anymore. Today is Tyr's day. I am shifting my 
emphasis to my online journal, but will probably incorporate this journal for 
notetaking.</p>
</font>
<p>Right now I'm in the middle of this dialogue between the dying Fafnir/dragon, 
and Sigurth.&nbsp; The dragon apparently goaded Sigurth into divulging his real 
identity, which has allowed him, as a dying man, to curse Sigurth.</p>
<p>Stanza 14 &quot;holm&quot;: island in a river</p>
<p>So in Stanza 14, Fafnir begins to describe the battle at Ragnarok.</p>
<p>And he goes on to tell Sigurth that the gold rings will be a bane to him, and 
that Regin will betray him.</p>

<p>I've continued, but haven't been writing (pppllllbbb)</p>
<p>vs 6,7,10,11,12,14&nbsp; All encourage caution, and little speech, when a 
guest, especially among strangers.&nbsp; Keep your wits about you, don't let 
your guard down, you never know who may have evil in their heart.</p>
<p>vs 8,9&nbsp; A short list of what to give to a traveller/guest:&nbsp; warmth, 
food, clean linen, water and washcloth.&nbsp; Courteous words and courteous 
silence.</p>
<p>vs 11 &quot;Seldom do those who are silent make mistakes;&quot;&nbsp; still my 'talkfulness' 
haunts me.</p>
<p>vs 14, 15, 16&nbsp; Good sense is better than riches, too much drink, mead.&nbsp; 
&quot;A man knows less the more he drinks.</p>
<p>vs 17, 18 Odin regrets getting drunk at Gunnlod's court. &quot;Best is the banquet 
one looks back on after, and remembers all that happened.</p>
<p>vs 19 the son of a Prince should be &quot;silent, but bravei n battle.&quot;</p>
<p>vs 20&nbsp; A coward mistakenly thinks he will live forever by hiding from 
trouble, but he will have no peace, and possible ill health, in his old age, 
even if he was spared from spear and sword.</p>

<p>I have not put my studies to rest, but have been away from this format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to read 5 lines from the Havamal every day, so that in each month I 
will have read it once.</p>
<p>This is the Auden/Taylor translation, which I guess rearranges the first 5 
lines from the middle of the text.</p>
<p>&quot;Young and alone on a long road, Once I lost my way:&nbsp; Rich I felt when I 
found another; Man rejoices in man.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate being alone, but I hate having everyone going in a 
different conversation.&nbsp; I want to be quietly with my family :)</p>
<p>&quot;A kind word need not cost much, The price of praise can be cheap:&nbsp; With 
half a loaf and an empty cup I found myself a friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of George, here.&nbsp; I should practice this more 
often, although I think in the last few years I've been naturally gravitating to 
this behavior.</p>
<p><br>
&quot;Two wooden stakes stood on the plain, On them I hung my clothes:&nbsp; Draped 
in linen, they looked well born, But, naked, I was a nobody.&quot;</p>
<p>He deliberately disguised himself to see how others would respond to him.&nbsp; 
He also doesn't mind being a nobody.&nbsp; Aragorn.&nbsp; Going forth to learn 
wisdom.</p>
<p>&quot;Too early to many homes I came, Too late, it seemed , to some:&nbsp; The ale 
was finished or else unbrewed, The unpopular cannot please.&quot;</p>
<p>I should think more about how I welcome others.&nbsp; I always feel 
unprepared, but should not pass that feeling on to others so that they feel 
unwelcome.</p>
<p>&quot;Some would invite me to visit their homes, But none thought I needed a meal, 
As though I had eaten a whole joint Just before with a friend who had two.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a play date with another woman and her child.&nbsp; 
She made lunch for the kids, and nothing for me.&nbsp; I didn't ask for 
anything, wondering if they were that hard up for money.&nbsp; I remember it 
still.</p>

<p>In a weird place.</p>
<p>I'm dealing with my atheism.&nbsp; I have no good reason to believe in 
deities or other spirits.&nbsp; I have no good reason to believe in magic, or 
anything I experience in altered states.</p>
<p>But when I read the Eddas, I want--something.&nbsp; When I look at this photo 
I just downloaded from National Geographic of an Icelandic Gothi praying over a 
burial mound, I want something.&nbsp; I feel some obligation.&nbsp; To what?</p>
<p>My head won't accept this.&nbsp; My heart won't let go.&nbsp; Where does this 
put me?</p>
<p>5/20/06</p>
<p>I feel I'm being sloppy about this work.&nbsp; I also want to begin to work 
on mnemonics.</p>

<p>Volvur: female spae worker</p>
<p>Thular: male spae worker</p>
<p>Spaecraft: the skill of seeing that which is unseen by others, and telling 
what should come to pass</p>
<p>Usually practiced by women.&nbsp; Some of them became the most honored 
members of their tribes. Usually prophetic and weal working.</p>
<p>Associated with the Norns.</p>
<p>The Volvo, Seidkona, or Thule had a seat prepared for them from which to 
speak. For the Thule, this may have been the kingly seat, and set on a burial 
mound.</p>

<p>5/23/06</p>
<p>Seidr</p>
<p>&quot;In the Old Norse sources, <cite>seiðr</cite> is nearly always portrayed as 
malicious&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The prophetic aspect of <cite>seiðr</cite>, if the terminology of <cite>
Eiríks saga</cite> can be trusted at all, appears to be a form of mediumship 
more similar to spiritualism: the beings are called into the stead and 
entertained by the recital of a specific chant before they will reveal their 
knowledge of what shall come to pass to the <cite>völva</cite>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beyond prophecy (overlapping with spae-craft), <cite>seiðr</cite> includes 
many other skills: here it is worth noting that, though the words <cite>spá</cite> 
and <cite>seiðr</cite> have both survived to this day in modern Icelandic, <cite>
spá</cite> is the only one used for prophecy: the word <cite>seiðr</cite> means 
'sorcery', the verb means 'to enchant, bewitch, or put a spell on'.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Today I am reading an article on Spae-Craft--&quot;Spae-Craft, 
Seiðr, and Shamanism&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">by Kveldúlfr Gundarsson.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Spae</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Advice on learning, or beginning: 
&quot;The practice of these techniques will not be spoken of at much length in this 
article because, to the unaccompanied beginner, soul-crafts are even more 
dangerous than more limited forms of magic such as galdr-craft. All sorts of 
magic can twist one's wyrd or cause harm unmeant; but when practicing 
soul-craft, you are travelling out into a perilous, unknown world filled with 
wights who may well not be friendly. Some of the hazards of this sort of travel 
include getting troll-shot (also: alf-shot, witch-shot, dwarf-shot), which can 
cause physical symptoms ranging from mild muscle spasms to bone cancer and 
nervous degeneration; having a part of your soul-complex stolen (in which case 
an experienced shaman has to be engaged to retrieve it) or eaten; being latched 
on to by an unpleasant wight which follows you about causing various sorts of 
trouble thereafter; and, worst of all, getting permanently lost, which, after 
some time, will cause your uninhabited body to rot and die - something which 
shows up quite often in, for instance, Finnish legends (see Pentikäinen, <cite>
Kalevala Mythology</cite>, pp. 187-88). The most practical advice I can give is: 
always set up wards before you go; put another layer of warding around yourself 
as soon as you are out of your body; go fully armed; and be ready to snap back 
to yourself at the first sign of trouble. Most of all, if you can possibly 
manage to do so, have a sober (non-tranced or only lightly tranced) partner who 
can keep an eye on your bodily and psychic state, get you back, and ground you. 
Although I am not usually willing to recommend that folk given to the Teutonic 
god/esses go outside of our tradition for training, if you wish to take up 
soul-work seriously and cannot find a teacher in your area who works in a 
Germanic context, it will probably be worthwhile to seek guidance from someone 
working in an authentic shamanic tradition (though beware of New Agers who will 
use the word to mean anything and everything), as basic trance-techniques are 
fairly universal....</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;The practice of spae-craft varied in 
the old days. Sometimes it seemed to call for special trance-techniques, as in 
the case of Þórgeirr the Lawspeaker who went 'under the cloak' for two days 
before deeming Iceland's religious future (and made the decision which preserved 
the religious lore of the North until it could be written down; had christianity 
been enforced in Iceland rather than accepted quietly, we would almost certainly 
have lost all the tales and elder lays of our god/esses). Other times, as in
<cite>Þiðranda þáttr ok Þórhalls</cite> (<cite>Flateyjarbók </cite>I, pp. 
418-21), where the words <cite>hyggja</cite> (to intuit) and <cite>bjoða</cite> 
(to bode) are used by Þórhallr spámaðr to describe his premonition, spae-craft 
seems to have been a matter of psychic sensing with no special effort made. The 
matter was clearly a question of both personal character and the situation at 
hand: Þórgeirr had a specific problem which he needed to resolve, whereas 
Þórhallr sensed the doom hanging over the upcoming Winternights festivities. 
Both types of spae-craft are highly useful. One can grow in the latter by 
careful attention to fore-bodings - by considering one's feelings, especially 
before large happenings and holy feasts, and writing them down, then waiting to 
see what comes of them. Close attention paid to personal feelings and outside 
omens, and their following consequences, at the three greatest feasts of the 
year (Yule, Ostara, and Winternights) and those on which divination is 
traditionally done in the North (Waluburg's Night and Midsummer) - can also help 
one recognise and develop one's own spae-craft, if one has the root talent.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;The craft of the thule can be 
practiced either directly, if one lives where one can sit upon a gravemound 
dwelt in by a wight with whom one is on good terms, or indirectly, through the 
addition of shamanic soul-faring techniques to bring one to the mound. The 
latter was obviously not practiced by our forebears, because they had no need 
for it: one can hardly walk in Northern Europe without tripping over a howe. 
However, America is another matter. If necessary, such a soul-faring can be 
undertaken either by first making the faring to Hel and looking about for a howe 
in the realm of the dead (you are likely to find one of your forebears in this 
manner), or by faring directly to the homeland and looking for an earthly howe 
upon which you may sit in spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>Brynhild's ride to Hel</p>
<p><b>Valkyrie:</b>&nbsp; chooser of the slain</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disr, who accompany Odin and battle, and accompany the 
half of the heroic slain to Valhalla, and the other to Freya at Folkvang</p>
<p>Basically, Brynhild aided a hero, and angered Odin, who punished her by being 
doomed to sleep behind a wall of flame. She is awakened by Sigurd, whom she 
falls in love with.&nbsp; Then she is doomed to seek his death.</p>
<p>5/12/06</p>
<p>Finished Brynildr's death.&nbsp; I am reading about Seidr, as I have been 
feeling.. . something...lately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5/8/06</p>
<p>Unknown date:</p>
<p>&quot;I keep saying I want my folks and sibs to find healing--maybe I should be 
bringing healing in the form of poetry, love, acceptance.&quot;</p>
<p>The Short Lay of Sigurth (Sigurtharkvitha hin skamma)</p>
<p>The story of how Brynhild's jealousy lead to the plot against Sigurth.</p>
<p>I read through the 20th stanza.</p>
<p>May 9&nbsp; Day of Remembrance for Guthroth</p>
<p>Guthroth was one of the Uppland kings of Norway, who attempted to incite his 
fellow kings to oppose Olav Haraldsson (995-1030).&nbsp; Much of Norway had 
already been Christianized, but Olav destroyed the remaining agricultural and 
Heathen strongholds.&nbsp; Guthroth was betrayed to Olav, who cut out his 
tongue.</p>
<p>5/4/2006</p>
<p>Busy week--took Rocco back to the CACC.&nbsp; Have mostly designed the 
backyard, am discussing the possibility of a cooperative agriculture project 
with some others.&nbsp; Slept poorly last night, did a little sword practice 
this am.</p>
<p>Read the Great Lacuna.</p>
<p>Today is the First Lay of Guthrun.</p>
<p>Guthrun's grief is powerful and poignant.</p>
<p>This, apparently inspired by Thorpe's translation:</p>
<h1>Alfred Lord Tennyson</h1>
<h2>Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead</h2>
<p>Home they brought her warrior dead:<br>
She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:<br>
All her maidens, watching, said,<br>
She must weep or she will die.</p>
<p>Then they praised him, soft and low,<br>
Called him worthy to be loved,<br>
Truest friend and noblest foe;<br>
Yet she neither spoke nor moved.</p>
<p>Stole a maiden from her place,<br>
Lightly to the warrior stepped,<br>
Took the face-cloth from the face;<br>
Yet she neither moved nor wept.</p>
<p>Rose a nurse of ninety years,<br>
Set his child upon her knee<br>
Like summer tempest came her tears<br>
Sweet my child, I live for thee.</p>
